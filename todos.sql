(2, 'Downing Street today is seen as the powerhouse of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is where the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer live and where Cabinet meetings are usually held, namely in the Cabinet Room of 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister\'s official residence.<br><br>\r\nWhat isn’t well known is that Downing Street didn’t become the residence of the Prime Minister until 1732. So, what was there before then?<br>\r\nIn the middle ages Downing Street itself didn’t even exist. It’s vague what was on the site originally but there is evidence towards a brewhouse called ‘The Axe’ that was owned by the Abbey of Abingdon. By the 16th Century ‘The Axe’ sadly fell into disuse.<br><br> In 1581 Sir Thomas Knyvet built the first residential house roughly on the site of Number 10. It was known as ‘The House on the Back’ at the time. Sir Thomas Knyvet was a favourite of Queen Elizabeth I and was actually the person responsible for arresting Guy Fawkes after the gunpowder plot against King James I of England and VI of Scotland.\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Portrait of Sir George Downing painted c. 1675–1690 by Thomas Smith, The Fogg Museum.jpeg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/The_Old_Palace_of_Whitehall_by_Hendrik_Danckerts.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/800px-Robertwalpole.jpg\">\r\n	</div>	\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; z-index: 99;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2\" style=“opacity:1; ”>\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content\" style=\"padding: 0; opacity:1;”>\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper2\" align=\"left\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n        	<h3 style=\"padding: 0px;\r\nfont: normal 1.125em/1.1 GaramondPremrPro,serif;\r\nline-height: 1.1;\r\nposition: relative;\r\ntop: -17px;\r\nline-height: 6px;\"> <span class=\"slide-tracker\">1</span> of 3 </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10\" style=\"padding:0px;\">\r\n			<ul class=\"data-list\" style=\"min-height:50px; position: relative; left:-10px;\">\r\n				<li class=\"team-active default\">\r\n					Portrait of Sir George Downing painted c. 1675–1690 by Thomas Smith, The Fogg Museum\r\n					<span>\r\n						Thomas Smith (d. 1691, active 1670s–1680s) - <a href=\"https://harvardartmuseums.org\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:inherit;\">harvardartmuseums.org</a>\r\n					</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					The Palace of Whitehall by Hendrick Danckerts c. 1660–1679.

Downing started to acquire land around the site through leases to build a row of townhouses and a cul-de-sac. Sir Christopher Wren was even brought in to design the houses. Although the houses were large, they were built quickly and cheaply and built on soft soil with shallow foundations. Even the fronts had facades with lines painted on the surface to imitate brick mortar. It is said that Sir George Downing never lived in the townhouses himself and retired to Cambridge where he died a few months after they were completed in 1684.<br><br> Right before Downing Street became the official residence of the Prime Minister - or the First Lord of the Treasury as it was known then - the last person to live in one of the three properties which comprise of 10 Downing Street today was called Mr. Chicken. There is no other information on Mr. Chicken other than his name and that he moved out in 1732 after Sir Robert Walpole convinced him to. It was after he moved out that King Charles II presented both houses to Walpole as a personal gift. Walpole didn’t accept the property as a gift unless the King made it available to him and all future First Lords of the Treasury in their official capacity. This title can be seen engraved on the letterbox on the black front door today even though the title ‘Prime Minister’ was introduced in 1905.\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Gates-at-the-main-entrance-of-Downing-Street,-Westminster,-London..jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/4446148131_f03549c784_b.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/1200px-Barack_Obama_and_Gordon_Brown_in_10_Downing_Street.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"3\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Churchill_V_sign_HU_55521.jpg\">\r\n	</div>	\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; z-index: 99;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2\" style=“opacity:1;margin-bottom: 0px; ”>\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content\" style=\"padding: 0; opacity:1;”>\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper2\" align=\"left\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n        	<h3 style=\"padding: 0px;\r\nfont: normal 1.125em/1.1 GaramondPremrPro,serif;\r\nline-height: 1.1;\r\nposition: relative;\r\ntop: -17px;\r\nline-height: 6px;\"> <span class=\"slide-tracker\">1</span> of 4 </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10\" style=\"padding:0px;\">\r\n			<ul class=\"data-list\" style=\"min-height:20px; position: relative; left:-10px; min-height: 50px;\">\r\n				<li class=\"team-active default\">\r\n					Gates at the Main Entrance of Downing Street, Westminister, London.\r\n\r\n					<span>Garry Knight / Entrance of Downing Street / Available on Flickr</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					Downing Street <span>\r\n					Robert Sharp / London / Available on Flickr</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					President Barack Obama is welcomed to 10 Downing Street in London by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, April 1, 2009\r\n					<span>Official White House Photo by Pete Souza</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					Winston Churchill emerging from Number 10 holding up the \"V\" sign for \"Victory\"\r\n					<span>British Government / Collections of the Imperial War Museums / Wikimedia Commons</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n			</ul>\r\n		</div>\r\n		<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>', 'Downing Street', '2018-07-26 9:15 pm', 'figure0748-108.gif', 'topics', '51.503181', '-0.126289', 0, 5, 0, 0, 1, 1, NULL, 6),
(3, 'In 1948, the British Nationality Act declared that all Commonwealth citizens (inhabitants of former British colonies), had the right to freely to enter and settle in Britain. Due to the ‘depressed economic situation’ in Jamaica at this time, when an advertisement in the Daily Gleaner offered passage to Britain for £28.10, many West Indians seized the chance to seek further employment and education opportunities in the ‘Mother country’.  Following a 22-day journey from Jamaica, on June 22nd 1948, the SS Empire Windrush arrived in Britain, docking just outside of London in Tilbury, Essex.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Empire-Windrush.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        The \'Empire Windrush\' arriving in London, England in 1948 bringing Immigrants from the Caribbean to the UK.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nStarting life as a German cruise boat, the Empire Windrush eventually wound up in Kingston, Jamaica, where it then set sail for the British Isles, officially carrying 492 Caribbean passengers, although this number is believed to be greater as the ship contained a number of stowaways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nOf this number, many had already visited British shores - 120 were in fact ex-servicemen who had fought with British forces during the war.  As post-war prosperity kicked-in, British industry found itself lacking the manpower to meet economic expansion. Many British employers thus looked to the former colonies in order to supply the labour needed to facilitate the rejuvenation of British industry.\r\n\r\n<h1> From Jamaica to Britain </h1>\r\nPassengers of the Empire Windrush and those that were to follow, set their sights on the British Isles for a number of reasons. For many, like Clinton Edwards who had served with the RAF during the war, “the opportunity for jobs was better than back home”.  Arthur Curling, also a former member of the British Airforce, felt that after his experience of traveling outside of the Caribbean, Jamaica simply felt “too small”.  Whilst many intended to settle in Britain permanently, others planned to move back after learning a trade or simply viewed Britain as a stepping stone on their way to America.  But regardless of individual motivations for the journey, for those undertaking the now historic voyage, coming to Britain represented the start of a new chapter.\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/WINDRUSH-GENERATION.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Jamaican immigrants welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship HMT ‘Empire Windrush’ landed them at Tilbury\r\n        <span>\r\n			(Picture: PA)\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nPrior to entering Britain, many passengers had self-organised employment and accommodation.  With the government apparently keen to ‘disperse’ the newcomers as quickly as possible, upon arrival those who had made such prior arrangements were issued free travel permits to get to them where they needed to go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThose without such plans were transported from Tilbury to London and hastily sheltered at the Deep Shelter at Clapham South, which had been re-opened for the purpose.  180 steps below ground, this subterranean shelter had previously acted as a place of refuge for many Londoners during the blitz.  But in 1948, at the behest of the Colonial Office, it became the temporary home of 236 expectant individuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the shelter, the newcomers were greeted by a welcome tent where each resident was ‘checked-in’, allocated a bunk and issued with a blanket and linen sheet.  After descending into what one passenger described as “the bowels of South London,” the group became acquainted with their first British home-base.\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/New-Arrivals.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n	\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/New-arrivals-2.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/clapham_south_old9.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; z-index: 99;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content no-padding visible\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper2\" align=\"left\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n        	<h3 style=\"padding: 0px;\r\n			font: normal 1.125em/1.1 GaramondPremrPro,serif;\r\n			line-height: 1.1;\r\n			position: relative;\r\n			top: -17px;\r\n			line-height: 6px;\"> <span class=\"slide-tracker\">1</span> of 3 </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10\" style=\"padding:0px;\">\r\n			<ul class=\"data-list\" style=\"min-height:20px; position: relative; left:-10px; min-height: 50px;\">\r\n				<li class=\"team-active default\">\r\n					The new arrivals were interviewed by the Ministry of Labour and National Service Office to help them find work.\r\n					<span>Source: Mirror.co.uk // Topfoto</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					Underground bunk beds with Windrush passengers.<span>\r\n					Source: BBC. </span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					Jamaican immigrants using the shelter as a hostel in July 1948. \r\n					<span>Source: subbrit.org.uk</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n			</ul>\r\n		</div>\r\n		<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\nOne passenger noted: <mark>We curiously eyed the network of poorly lit, clammy, musty tunnels that had been offered as residence. It was primitive and unwelcoming, like a sparsely furnished rabbit’s warren. </mark>\r\n<br><br>\r\nFortunately, few of the deep shelter’s new inhabitants were subjected to these surroundings for too long. Utilising the local labour exchange in Cold harbour Lane, Brixton, within a month nearly all had secured accommodation and employment.  Taking up positions in a range of environments including the NHS and transport services, the new arrivals found work in essential industries that were key to post-war regeneration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nOutwardly, the Colonial Office congratulated themselves for a job well done. However, as had been the case since the imminence of the ship’s arrival, internal conversations were less encouraging.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAfter learning of the Windrush’s imminent arrival, many alarmed MPs expressed their concern to Prime Minister Atlee, stating:\r\n“The British people fortunately enjoy a profound unity without uniformity in their way of life, and we are blest by the absence of a colour racial problem. An influx of coloured people domiciled here is likely to impair the harmony, strength and cohesion of our public and social life.”\r\n<br><br>\r\nHowever, after the war, in a bid to move away from a pre-war ‘imperial dominance’, Britain was eager to demonstrate its commitment to the creation of a fairer society. As part of such commitment, the Labour government desired to forge a new, more familial relationship with Commonwealth countries.  It was amidst this collaborative spirit that the 1948 Nationality Act and Commonwealth recruitment drives emerged.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUnfortunately, the unwelcoming attitude expressed by certain MPs was also manifest in numerous British newspapers. News of the hostility reached the Caribbean, prompting concern over the potentially negative treatment was awaiting migrants. In response the Atlee government was keen to publicly alleviate any unease.  As historian Kenneth Lunn notes, any indication of restrictions or attitudes “which smacked of a ‘colour bar’”, risked provoking charges of racism that the government wished to avoid.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut, whilst the British government was anxious to avoid appearing unwelcoming, at the same time a governmental feeling existed within Whitehall that a precedent should not be set. Many MPs wished to avoid providing too warm a welcome. They did not want to run the risk of encouraging others to follow suit and turning the country into what was described as “an open reception centre for immigrants”.  A further governmental concern was that the migrants be dispersed across the country as soon as possible.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe logic being that if the new arrivals were scattered widely enough, their presence would be less likely to attract negative attention, such as had already been seen in port communities such as Liverpool which was home to an existing black community.  As the Windrush approached, tensions arose between the Colonial Office, the Home Office and the Ministry of Labour - each department was keen to avoid assuming responsibility for facilitating the newcomers’ imminent arrival.  On the outside an apparent open door policy prevailed. Behind closed doors tensions about the implications of the new arrivals were bubbling.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, no formal policy in relation to West Indian immigration was formulated. Despite a recorded deterioration in race relations during the immediate post war years, and an awareness of hostile public attitudes towards black settlement, the government failed to enact legislation against racial discrimination.  Concerns over the treatment of the West Indian migrants were voiced. Yet, for various reasons, no solid action was taken to safeguard the reception and treatment of migrant communities.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWithin this period of ambivalence, although the official line was that the new arrivals had been settled and dispersed with apparent ease, in reality the country’s new inhabitants received a less than warm welcome. Many experienced extreme racism and intolerance from certain areas of society, denied access to certain employment opportunities and better housing on basis of their skin-colour.   As a result of this discrimination, many of the West Indian migrants ended up settling in “the meanest housing” of inner city London in areas such as Brixton and Notting Hill where they faced “slum landlords, high rents and overcrowding”.  Making the line the official governmental line of ‘success’ difficult to understand.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h1> Long-term Impact </h1>\r\nThe way post-war governmental approaches to immigration have shaped the longer-term experiences of the Windrush community. In light of the 2018 ‘Windrush Scandal’ and the wrongful deportation of a number of individuals, it is evident that the after-shocks of the poor treatement of the Windrush generation experienced in the years proceeding 1948 is still being felt today.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFollowing the 1948 Nationality Act, those arriving from Commonwealth countries were legally British subjects, however for many who came to Britain between 1948 and 1971, the experience has not always reflected this. As British citizens, those arriving with the Windrush generation were not immigrants, but migrants. Yet following their arrival, race became a marker used to strip these legal citizens of social acceptance.\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-bg-image\">\r\n	<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/We-are-not-illegal.jpg\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content visible no-padding\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:-30px;\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        The Windrush scandal is a 2018 British political scandal concerning people who were wrongly detained, denied legal rights, threatened with deportation, and, in around 63 cases, wrongly deported from the UK.

Headlines may have read ‘Welcome Home’, but in reality, beyond the initial arrival of the first new arrivals, there was a lack of governmental policy in place designed to maintain support and integration for those settling in Britain from Commonwealth nations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDespite this, plans were in place to recruit from the Caribbean in order to satisfy the need for labour in key industries, such as London transport which was actively advertising vacancies in Barbados.  By 1958, there were around 125,000 Caribbean workers in Britain, with a disproportionate amount of these individuals represented in semi and unskilled roles. Due to the absence of official support, in addition to a concentration of black migrants in certain industries, migrants were left to secure housing through an “informal network of support”.  This led to a clustering of black migrants in certain urban areas, which made their presence seem greater and caused alarm to many of the local white population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h1> Racism </h1>\r\nAs Caribbean migration grew, so too did the racist attitude of many white Britons towards the growing black communities. Claiming that the newcomers were taking jobs from capable White Britons, during the 1950s there was an increasingly hostile attitude towards black people. The growing concern over the ‘dangers of unrestricted immigration’ was reflected within the media, the tone of which had shifted from support of unrestricted migrant labour to one of suspicion.  It was not uncommon for black citizens to face discrimination in a number of public environments including, hotels, shops, schools or housing.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFascist groups such as Oswald Mosley’s fascist Union Movement, Colin Jordan’s White Defence League and the League of Empire Loyalists added fuel to the fire. Yet there was still no recourse from the law to address the mounting racism within the country, which led to violent clashes during the 1958 Notting Hill Riots.\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Oswald-Mosley.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/1958 Notting Hill race riots.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/KBW.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; z-index: 99;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content no-padding visible\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper2\" align=\"left\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n        	<h3 style=\"padding: 0px;\r\n			font: normal 1.125em/1.1 GaramondPremrPro,serif;\r\n			line-height: 1.1;\r\n			position: relative;\r\n			top: -17px;\r\n			line-height: 6px;\"> <span class=\"slide-tracker\">1</span> of 3 </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10\" style=\"padding:0px;\">\r\n			<ul class=\"data-list\" style=\"min-height:20px; position: relative; left:-10px; min-height: 50px;\">\r\n				<li class=\"team-active default\">\r\n					Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists, at a rally in East London.\r\n					<span>Source: Wikimedia Commons</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					The Notting Hill race riots were a series of racially motivated riots that took place in Notting Hill, England, between 29 August and 5 September 1958.\r\n					<span>\r\n					Source: Wikimedia Commons</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					Young lady points to \'Keep Britain White\' graffiti at the International Personnel training centre in Balham.\r\n					<span>Source: Neil Kenlock // Tate</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n			</ul>\r\n		</div>\r\n		<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\nIn response to growing racial tension at the influx of new arrivals, in 1962, the Commonwealth Immigration Act was passed in order to curb the number of those travelling from Commonwealth countries into Britain.  The act introduced a system that required hopeful migrants to obtain government-issued work permits before they could enter.  But it was not until 1965 that policy directly addressing racial discrimination was made when the Race Relations Act came into effect making racial discrimination unlawful in public spaces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nRelating to both British citizens and visitors, the law prohibited any form of discrimination based on a person’s colour, race or ethnic origins. Whilst there were those who resisted such reform, it was criticised for not going far enough. For example, it did not cover housing or employment where the issue was often most prevalent. This led to the passing of the Race Relations Act 1968 which sought to address areas such as housing, employment and advertising which were previously omitted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"side-note\">\r\nThe Race Relations Act 1968 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom making it illegal to refuse housing, employment, or public services to a person on the grounds of colour, race, ethnic or national origins. It also created the Community Relations Commission to promote \'harmonious community relations\'. Wikipedia\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1971 the Immigration Act gave all Commonwealth Citizens already living in the UK indefinite leave to remain. In a further bid to control the number of people settling in the UK, the law also put an end to freedom of movement for Commonwealth citizens.  However, the Home Office never issued paperwork for those granted leave to remain to confirm their status, nor did they keep a record of those affected by the act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nFast forward a number of decades and the ‘Windrush Scandal’ appears to be a part of the wider continuum of black British experience. After being invited to Britain to provide vital support in the post-war reconstruction efforts, many British citizens have found themselves having their legal status questioned.  In addition to the absence of records created and issued during the 1970s, it has come to light that in 2010 the landing cards completed by incoming Commonwealth citizens, which were being stored by the Home Office, had been destroyed.  This lack of paperwork has led to serious problems for many of the Windrush generation. In 2012, strict changes to immigration law designed to target illegal immigration required that people provide the documentation confirming their right to work, rent or have access to healthcare.\r\n\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-bg-image\">\r\n	<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Hosstile-Environment.jpg\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content visible no-padding\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:-30px;\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        The UK Home Office hostile environment policy is a set of administrative and legislative measures designed to make staying in the United Kingdom as difficult as possible for people without leave to remain, in the hope that they may \"voluntarily leave\".\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikipedia\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nAlthough legal citizens, many of the Windrush generation unable to produce the necessary paperwork have suddenly found their legal status questioned. The number of those affected remains unclear, as many of the Windrush generation travelled on parental passports and never applied for travel documents of their own. After being born or living in Britain for decades, a number of individuals have been wrongfully threatened with deportation to countries they may have not seen for 50 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor some, the image of hundreds of Caribbean-born individuals filing off the ship’s gangplank in 1948 has become synonymous with “the beginning of modern British multicultural society”.  It is estimated that following the arrival of the Windrush and its passengers in 1948, by 1971 nearly half a million West Indian-born individuals left their homes to settle in Britain. This Caribbean diaspora has come to be known as the Windrush Generation.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhen this piece of Black & British history has been given close attention, there has been a tendency to depict the arrival of the Windrush as a watershed moment in the history of black migration to Britain, prompting questions of race and the formation of the modern British identity.  It has been depicted as the ‘symbolic point of origin’ from which narratives surrounding British citizens of African descent should stem.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAccording to this perspective, 1948 is extoled as the opening chapter of the tumultuous road to becoming contemporary multicultural Britain. However, recent years have witnessed concerted efforts to re-think this narrative. As Barnor Hesse reminds us in his book Un/settled Multiculturalisms, the portrayal of Black Britain as a post-war phenomenon is misleading, overlooking the individual stories of people of African descent who settled in Britain prior to 1948.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFurthermore, it suggests that racial tension within Britain is a relatively ‘recent’ issue resulting from the demographic upheaval of the post-war years, when in fact the problem of racism in Britain has a much longer history. To gain a deeper understanding of Britain’s migration history is to gain a better understanding of our current identity. Failure to do so is to perpetuate the historical amnesia that leads to the ignorance and prejudice that we must work to eradicate.\r\n', 'Windrush Generation', '2018-08-05 7:32 am', 'Windrush_Picture.jpg', 'topics', '', '', 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, NULL, 6),
(4, 'Situated at the junction of Lexington Street and Broadwick Street is The John Snow, a public house that has honoured its nineteenth-century namesake since 1958. This site proves both a historic and modern appreciation for the work on public health by Dr John Snow, making it an important piece of London’s medical and social history. Snow was credited with advancing epidemiology (the study of the spread of disease) and moving past outdated theories of contagion. <br><br>\r\n   \r\n\r\nThe pub itself stands on Broadwick Street, previously known as Broad Street, around which Snow famously surveyed an outbreak of cholera in 1854. After successfully tracing the disease back to a contaminated water pump the handle was removed and instances of cholera, although already declining, continued to wane. A replica of this handleless pump was erected nearby on Broadwick Street in 1992 and was, along with The John Snow and various commemorative plaques in the area, a popular icon of the physician’s important contributions to public health. The replica was removed in 2015 due to ongoing building improvements, however has yet to return and is instead marked by a piece of red granite.\r\n\r\n        <br>\r\n       <div align=\"center\" class=\"article-img-wrapper\">\r\n            <img class=\"img\" src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/John-Snow.jpg\">\r\n            <div class=\"caption\">\r\n                <i>Dr. John Snow (1813-1858), British physician. (Wikimedia Commons)</i>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n    \r\nBorn to a farming family in York, England in 1813, it can definitely be said that Snow was from humble beginnings. A commemorative plaque and water pump similar to those on Broadwick Street mark his origins in North Street, York, over 200 miles north of The John Snow in the capital. \r\n<br />\r\nAt the age of fourteen Snow worked as a medical apprentice in Newcastle, England, and witnessed the Newcastle cholera epidemic of 1831-32. Whether this peaked his interest in the prevalent and deadly disease is unclear, but nevertheless Snow went on to train as a physician in the years following. \r\n         \r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nHis prowess within medicine is evident from his various memberships of colleges and societies: the Royal College of Surgeons; the Westminster Medical Society (later the Medical Society of London); and a founding member of the London Epidemiological Society. During his life he published his findings in several papers, both on his epidemiological studies and pioneering experimentation on medical anesthetic. \r\n         \r\n<br /><br />\r\nSnow’s curiosity of health and disease also infiltrated his personal life; he was a vegetarian, teetotaler, and purified his water through distillation. These quirks supposedly aided his health and he campaigned for them to be recognized, going as far as to refer to alcohol as a “physical evil” in an address given in 1836. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nDespite his health-conscious lifestyle, Snow died an early death aged only 45. The cause of death is speculated over; suggestions range from a stroke, to over-exposure to experimental chemicals, and even his extreme health-habits. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h3>Cholera and the Broad St. Pump</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nCholera in the 1800s was rife due to poor sanitation and a lack of knowledge as to how exactly it could be contracted. Pandemics hit England and Scotland several times throughout the century and caused widespread panic due to the fast-acting nature of the disease. The main symptoms of cholera are vomiting and diarrhea, leading quickly to dehydration and potentially death when untreated. Anxiety over contagion lead to a Board of Health releasing local reports on supposed disease prevention. \r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe leading theory on how cholera spread was known as “miasma”, meaning “pollution” or bad air. It was thought that diseases could be spread by foul-smelling, toxic gases - a logical theory as disease appeared to spread faster around open sewage, rotten meat, rats, and generally poor conditions. The germ theory at this point had yet to be discovered, meaning advice tended towards moving away from the pollution.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nJohn Snow published his contrary speculations on how cholera seemed to spread in his 1849 pamphlet entitled “On the Mode of Communication of Cholera”. He put forward that miasmic theory did not sufficiently explain the spreading pattern and time of symptoms known with cholera, meaning that the disease may not be spread by bad smells or inhalation of contaminated air. He posed that perhaps open sewers coming into contact with drinking water was to blame. After several case studies of parishes around the Thames, and also cities further afield, Snow published a more comprehensive text on his new theory. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nInterestingly, of the several case studies looked at by Snow, the outbreak on Broad St. was one that did not originally fit his hypothesis. He tested the drinking water of the area and found it to be relatively pure, meaning he “hesitated to come to a conclusion”. After retesting, however, he found that the impurity of the water fluctuated from high to low, meaning his theory of water contamination causing the outbreak may have still been possible. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nAfter acquiring a list of deaths from the Soho General Register Office Snow plotted the number of deaths caused by cholera in the area on a map, and found them to be concentrated around a water pump on Broad Street (only 10 of 83 deaths that he counted at this point occurred in houses closer to a different street pump than Broad Street - half of these cases informed Snow they drank from the Broad Street pump anyway, another 3 were likely to have attended a school near the pump). \r\n\r\n<h3>Snow describes the famous conclusion and consequence:</h3>\r\nThe result of the inquiry was then was, that there had been no particular outbreak or increase in cholera, in this part of London, except among the persons that were in the habit of drinking the water of the above-mentioned pump well.I had an interview with the Board of Guardians of St. James’s parish, on the evening of Thursday, 7th September, and presented the above circumstances to them. In consequence of what I said, the handle of the pump was removed the following day.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJohn Snow’s focus on practical prevention of cholera, rather than fruitlessly studying the disease itself, slowly ushered in a new era of public health. His understanding of water contamination as opposed to miasmic theory was slow to be accepted as it was a huge shift in thinking and had huge repercussions on everyday life (in the location of cesspits, for example). It would not be until Robert Koch discovered the bacterium responsible for cholera almost three decades later that Snow’s research was more readily accepted. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>Anaesthesia</h3>\r\n\r\nAlongside his research into the spread of cholera, John Snow is also credited with bringing medical anaesthesia into fashion. Having experimented using both ether and chloroform on animals, Snow studied the benefits and potential risks of both. He built on various designs of other scientists to perfect an “anaesthetic inhaler”, where the patient could simply breath in without worrying about correct concentrations and dosages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1853 Snow administered chloroform to Queen Victoria during the birth of her eighth child, Leopold. Due to reservations over the new anaesthetic inhaler Snow used the “open-drop method”; where material would be placed over the patient’s nose and mouth and chloroform dropped on the surface so the patient can inhale the vapour. Snow’s casenotes describe the Queen after the birth to have been “very cheerful and well, expressing herself much gratified with the effect of the chloroform.” \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nHesitancies over numbing the pain of childbirth existed prior to this event due to biblical emphasis on the ‘curse of Eve’: having given into temptation in the Garden of Eden Eve would be cursed to have pain in childbirth. Some believed that the easing of this pain was deliberately going against the word of God, however Queen Victoria’s example paved the way for further use of medical anaesthesia in other types of surgery and dentistry as well as obstetrics. \r\n', 'John Snow Public House', '2018-08-21 8:18 pm', 'john_snow.jpg', 'topics', '51.5132742', '-0.1387813', 0, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, NULL, 5);

The statue commissioned by the Gresley Society Trust, designed and created by Hazel Reeves, was unveiled on the 5th April 2016. Originally this design was going to include a mallard duck on the ground next to Gresley to represent one of his famous creations, but the final decision was to not include this feature.

Much of the wall was dismantled during the 1700s, however hardy sections can still be glimpsed, standing proudly as bastions of London’s ancient past. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nUnbeknownst to many, a substantial portion of the wall remains within the courtyard of The Grange City Hotel on Cooper’s Row.

They made up a series of defensive ‘stop-lines’. Pillboxes made up Britain’s final line of defence in the event of a German invasion – a very real threat in the aftermath of the evacuation of British and Allied troops from the beaches of Northern France in late May and early June 1940, known as the Dunkirk evacuation.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe pillbox on Putney Bridge is of the type 22 design. Most structures followed set guidelines but were altered depending on the local area’s availability of materials and its environment.

(12, 'Throughout history, women have been subject to discrimination and mistreatment. As the world has evolved and progressed life has gradually improved for women thanks to the devoted, brave and determined efforts of women’s activists. In the early twentieth century the women\'s suffrage movement led this fight in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe 1832 Great Reform Act, defined British voters primarily as ‘male persons\'. Women were not permitted to vote due to their husbands, or male relatives, being responsible to represent their views in all political matters. This was the first time it had explicitly been stated by law that women were not allowed to vote. In that same year, the first petition on women’s suffrage was presented to Parliament by Mary Smith.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Mary-Smith.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Mary Ellen Smith, from a 1918 publication.

However, the all-male House of Commons rejected John Stuart Mill’s Second Reform Bill petition, which contained over 1500 signatures. This petition, which would have allowed women to vote on the same property terms as men, was rejected by 194 votes to 73.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter the dismissal of this amendment, the women’s suffrage campaign gained momentum. This was evident in the formation of several formal suffrage societies across England and Ireland, which then amalgamated to form the National Society for Women\'s Suffrage (NSWS). The first public meeting about women’s suffrage was held in Manchester\'s Free Trade Hall in 1868. Among the audience was 15-year-old Emmeline Goulden, who was to become an ardent campaigner for women\'s rights, and who would later become the wife of Dr. Pankhurst, becoming Mrs Emmeline Pankhurst.\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/John-Stuart-MIll.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n	\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/The_Free_Trade_Hall,_Manchester.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/emmiline-pankhurst.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; z-index: 99;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content no-padding visible\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper2\" align=\"left\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n        	<h3 style=\"padding: 0px;\r\n			font: normal 1.125em/1.1 GaramondPremrPro,serif;\r\n			line-height: 1.1;\r\n			position: relative;\r\n			top: -17px;\r\n			line-height: 6px;\"> <span class=\"slide-tracker\">1</span> of 3 </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10\" style=\"padding:0px;\">\r\n			<ul class=\"data-list\" style=\"min-height:20px; position: relative; left:-10px; min-height: 50px;\">\r\n				<li class=\"team-active default\">\r\n					Painting of John Stuart Mill.

In 1869, the Municipal Franchise Act provided single women ratepayers rights to vote in local elections; twenty-five years later, the 1895 Local Government Act permitted women who owned property the right to vote in local elections. Women, however, recognised that more could – and needed to – be done to grant them their basic political freedoms. Owing to the failure of the 1884 Third Reform Act and the ineffectiveness of the National Society for Women\'s Suffrage (NSWS), the NUWSS (National Union of Women\'s Suffrage Societies) spearheaded by Millicent Fawcett, was formed in 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nKnown as ‘suffragists’, they employed a fair and legal approach in their campaign of convincing the government to give voting rights to middle-class property-owning women. This involved peace walks, petitions, confronting Members of Parliament, sharing pamphlets, conducting speeches, and letter writing campaigns. Their peaceful and gradualist nature was not only a reflection of their leader, who did not want women to be considered unfit for politics due to unruly behaviour, but also due to the structure of the leadership of the union which comprised mainly of middle-class women that were cautious of not ruining their reputation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-bg-image\">\r\n	<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Millicent-fawcett.jpg\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content visible no-padding\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n        <p>“ I would rather be a rebel than a slave.\" </p> <small>Emmeline Pankhurst</small>\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Emmeline Pankhurst & the WSPU</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nImpatient with the gradualist approach, factions were created in the National Union of Women\'s Suffrage Societies. In 1903, some members of the union, led by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters Christabel and Sylvia, set up a separate society that became known as the Women\'s Social and Political Union (WSPU). Pankhurst believed drastic measures were required, and further claimed it would take an active organisation with working-class women to draw attention to the cause. This was the birth of a militant campaign with “Deeds not Words!” and “Votes for Women!” adopted as slogans.\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div>\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Pankhurst-and-her-daughters.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/emmiline-pankhurst-and-the-wspujpg.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/emmiline-pankhurst-older.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"3\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/banners.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; z-index: 99;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content no-padding visible\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper2\" align=\"left\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n        	<h3 style=\"padding: 0px;\r\n			font: normal 1.125em/1.1 GaramondPremrPro,serif;\r\n			line-height: 1.1;\r\n			position: relative;\r\n			top: -17px;\r\n			line-height: 6px;\"> <span class=\"slide-tracker\">1</span> of 4 </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10\" style=\"padding:0px;\">\r\n			<ul class=\"data-list\" style=\"min-height:20px; position: relative; left:-10px; min-height: 50px;\">\r\n				<li class=\"team-active default\">\r\n					In 1903, some members of the union, led by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters Christabel and Sylvia, set up a separate society that became known as the Women\'s Social and Political Union (WSPU).\r\n\r\n					<span>Source: LSE Library / Available on Flickr</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					Meeting of Women\'s Social & Political Union (WSPU) leaders, c.1906 - c.1907\r\n					<span>\r\n					Source: LSE Library / Available on Flickr</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					Oil Painting of Emmeline Pankhurst\r\n					<span>Source: LSE Library / Available on Flickr</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					WSPU Members making banners\r\n					<span>Source: LSE Library / Available on Flickr</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n			</ul>\r\n		</div>\r\n		<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\nIn October 1905, the arrest of Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney at liberal meeting held at the Manchester Free Trade Hall marked the beginning of the militant campaign. Having interrupted the meeting of prominent liberal politicians by asking them what their stands were about women’s voting rights, they were charged with obstruction and spitting on a police officer. On refusal to pay the fine imposed by the court, they went to prison and this generated publicity for the cause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1906, the Daily Mail coined the name ‘suffragette’ to describe the predominantly younger women who advocated more radical tactics. The “ette” ending was supposed to belittle Annie Kenney and her fellow WSPU members. Instead, the WSPU proudly adopted the name, saying \"suffraGETtes\" (stressing the GET while they pronounced the term), to imply that they were adamant to achieve their goals. From 1909, the sale of the \"Pank-A-Squith\" (Pankhurst and Asquith) board game was used to raise money and gain publicity for the cause. The board game’s principle strategy required players to lead their suffragette figure from their home to Parliament, past the obstacles faced from Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, and the Liberal government.\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-bg-image\">\r\n	<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Annie_Kenney_and_Christabel_Pankhurst.jpg\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content visible no-padding\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:-30px;\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Annie Kenney and Christabel Pankhurst were dedicated suffragettes who paved the way for others.

Many men were committed to the cause, and actively participated in the campaign. Notable examples include Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, George Lansbury MP, and Keir Hardie MP who regularly raised the issue of women enfranchisement in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1906, James Keir Hardie introduced Frederick and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence to Emmeline Pankhurst. An apartment in Clement’s Inn, between Lincoln’s Inn Fields and Aldwych was home to them both, and it became the headquarters of the fledgling Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU). With the organisation only admitting female members, Frederick was not an official member. As a barrister, he represented WSPU in legal matters and stood bail for more than one-hundred members.\r\n\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/1.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/2.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/3.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; z-index: 99;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content no-padding visible\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper2\" align=\"left\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n        	<h3 style=\"padding: 0px;\r\n			font: normal 1.125em/1.1 GaramondPremrPro,serif;\r\n			line-height: 1.1;\r\n			position: relative;\r\n			top: -17px;\r\n			line-height: 6px;\"> <span class=\"slide-tracker\">1</span> of 3 </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10\" style=\"padding:0px;\">\r\n			<ul class=\"data-list\" style=\"min-height:20px; position: relative; left:-10px; min-height: 50px;\">\r\n				<li class=\"team-active default\">\r\n					Mrs Emmeline Pankhurst and Mrs Mabel Tuke photographed in Mrs Pankhurst\'s office in Clements Inn.\r\n					<span>Source: LSE Library / Available on Flickr</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst on the roof at Clement’s Inn, London, October 1908.

They were also committed in giving WSPU sizeable financial contributions. In 1907, Frederick founded the WSPU periodical, ‘Votes for Women’ with Emmeline and himself as joint editors. This periodical, which sold over 20,000 copies each week, helped recruit WSPU members and win public support for the cause.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 1912, large-scale smashing of shop windows along Oxford Street, led to the arrest of the couple even though they had nothing to do with the event.

It was not until she and her sisters sneaked into India in 1903, to see the celebration of the accession of King Edward VII, that she changed from a vacuous socialite to a political activist. On her visit to India, she came face to face with all that her family had lost, saw abject poverty and experienced racism at first hand. She attributed these factors to the severity of the British colonial rule. In 1909, Singh came back to England with an awakened sense of dispossession, and discovered the appeal for votes for women irresistible, and so she soon joined the Women’s Social and Political Union.\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Sophia-and-Her-Sisters.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/sophia\'s father.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Sophia-selling-paperss.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; z-index: 99;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content no-padding visible\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper2\" align=\"left\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n        	<h3 style=\"padding: 0px;\r\n			font: normal 1.125em/1.1 GaramondPremrPro,serif;\r\n			line-height: 1.1;\r\n			position: relative;\r\n			top: -17px;\r\n			line-height: 6px;\"> <span class=\"slide-tracker\">1</span> of 3 </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10\" style=\"padding:0px;\">\r\n			<ul class=\"data-list\" style=\"min-height:20px; position: relative; left:-10px; min-height: 50px;\">\r\n				<li class=\"team-active default\">\r\n					The last of the empire: Daughters of Maharajah Duleep Singh; Bamba, Catherine and Sophia — photographed in 1892.\r\n\r\n					<span>Source: Wikimedia Commons</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					Sophia\'s father, Maharajah Duleep Singh, was born in Lahore in 1838, and came to the throne of the Punjab at the age of five years.\r\n					<span>\r\n					 Image Source: Wikimedia Commons</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>Princess Sophia Duleep Singh selling subscriptions for the Suffragette newspaper outside Hampton Court in London, April 1913.\r\n					<span>Source: Wikimedia Commons</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n			</ul>\r\n		</div>\r\n		<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\nAs a suffragette, Singh donated and raised vast amounts of money for the organisation, including when violence and arson attacks were prominent. Singh vandalised her census paper, defied court judgments awarded against her, and as a member of the Women’s Tax Resistance league, refused to pay her taxes. Living in Hampton Court in an apartment in Faraday House, given to her by Queen Victoria, she sold the suffragette’s newspaper ‘The Vote’ outside Hampton Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, she threw herself at Prime Minister Asquith’s car, slamming a ‘Votes for Women’ pamphlet against his window but was released without charge. Despite Singh\'s activism as a suffragette, she was never arrested as she was a royal and her arrest would have attracted maximum attention to an ‘unwanted’ political cause. Singh marched next to Emmeline on 18 November 1910, an event that would become known as the Black Friday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h1> Suffragettes, Violence and Militancy </h1>\r\n\r\nMembers of the Suffragettes were prepared to use violence to reach their designed goal of women’s political freedoms. Their militant tactics involved the interruption of anti-suffrage ministers, arson attacks on post box contents and empty public places, and window smashing. To protest the Church of England, who were not in support of women’s voting rights, the WSPU were known to place bombs inside Westminster Abbey, St. Paul’s Cathedral and other Anglican churches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nGolf courses, cricket pitches, horse racing tracks and places where the affluent frequented were also destroyed when unattended. On 19 February 1913, one of the two bombs which was targeted at Pinfold Manor in Surrey, which was being built for Chancellor of the exchequer, David Lloyd-George, exploded, causing significant damage. Further targets included train stations, houses of anti-suffrage ministers, and libraries.\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/The Daily Mirror.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/sufragettes-arson-attacks.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Painting.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"3\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/wargrave.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"4\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/2nd-paiting.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; z-index: 99;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content no-padding visible\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper2\" align=\"left\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n        	<h3 style=\"padding: 0px;\r\n			font: normal 1.125em/1.1 GaramondPremrPro,serif;\r\n			line-height: 1.1;\r\n			position: relative;\r\n			top: -17px;\r\n			line-height: 6px;\"> <span class=\"slide-tracker\">1</span> of 5 </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10\" style=\"padding:0px;\">\r\n			<ul class=\"data-list\" style=\"min-height:20px; position: relative; left:-10px; min-height: 50px;\">\r\n				<li class=\"team-active default\">\r\n					The front page of The Daily Mirror, 19 November 1910, showing a suffragette on the ground, having been hit by a policeman.\r\n\r\n					<span>Source: Wikimedia Commons</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					Police survey Saunderton Railway Station after a suffragette arson attack, March 9th, 1913.\r\n					<span>\r\n					 Source: Wikimedia Commons</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>J.S.

Suffragettes continued to damage property in Downing Street and further chained themselves to railings at the Prime Minister’s residence to gain the Prime Minister’s attention. On 18 November 1910, despite making it to the second reading, Prime Minister Herbert Asquith decided not to proceed with the Conciliation Bill, which would have provided women with the ability to vote. This response was met with a protest from suffragettes, who viciously protested outside Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDue to the involvement of police and male vigilantes, the protest resulted in failure. Many women became injured and some protesters lost their lives for the cause. Many male and female protesters were also arrested during the rally. Marked as the ‘Black Friday of British women’s suffrage campaign’, the rally on 18 November 1910 gained publicity and sympathetic support for the WSPU, and increased support from newspapers through pictures of unarmed women being assaulted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/march.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        In 1908, owing to the absence of Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, 500,000 activists rallied through Hyde Park in London and proceeded towards Downing Street\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: BBC.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd April 1911, the Suffragette organisation urged women to boycott the census, which was controlled by the Liberal government. With the rallying call of, “If women don’t count, neither shall they be counted”, the censuses boycott emerged from the Women’s Freedom League campaign for non-violent ‘passive resistance’ against the government. This saw many women deface their census schedule, or spend the night away from home to avoid being counted. Women kept moving from place to place, hid, or gathered at the home of a census resister. One house in Manchester resulted in it being renamed “census lodge”, as it housed many census evaders.\r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nIn London, some gathered for a midnight picnic of roast fowl, sweetmeats and tea at Wimbledon Common. Others spent the night walking, talking and singing at Trafalgar Square. A vegetarian restaurant in Covent Garden stayed open to provide refreshments. In many parts of the nation – namely Cardiff, Bristol, Liverpool, Ipswich, Cheltenham, Reading and Maidstone – suffragettes hosted overnight events with the sole purpose of boycotting the census.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Census.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       	Suffragettes gathered in Manchester Census Lodge to Boycott the 1911 Census.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n        <p>“ If I am intelligent enough to fill in this census form,</p><p> I can surely make an x on a ballot form\" </p> <small>Miss Kate Gillie (April 1911)</small>\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\nMany women vandalised the census by defacing their forms or by completing them with inappropriate answers. One notable example includes Mary Howey of Hertfordshire, who inscribed a large “votes for women” on her form, and listed her occupation as “artist and suffragette”. Another example includes Miss Davies, a suffragette from Birkenhead who wrote on her form the name of a male servant, and added that there were no other persons present within the home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe same night, Emily Wilding Davison, who would tragically lose her life two years later, hid in a broom cupboard in the Houses of Parliament for 46 hours. Though caught and arrested she was released without charge. Boycotting the census showed a lot of courage as protesters expected a fine of £5 or a month’s imprisonment. However, no person was prosecuted, theoretically due to the large-scale number of suffragettes involved, and due to the criticism, that would have occurred if this was the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/census-slip.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       	The Census form has been returned blank and in place of household details, a large \'Votes for Women\' flyer has been stuck.

A letter to The Times labelled the boycott as a \"crime against science\", while the political magazine Punch joked: \"the suffragettes have definitely taken leave of their census\". Despite many women boycotting the census, their efforts were negligible in nullifying the census as many were counted while on the streets and some households listed the name of their missing occupants. Nevertheless, whilst it did not nullify the census results it gave public attention to the injustices of the British voting system, the suffragette movement and its campaign for ‘Votes for Women’.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h1> Cat and mouse: Force Feeding the suffragettes </h1>\r\nBetween 1905 and 1914, around 1000 suffragettes had been arrested and given prison sentences of anywhere from 3 days to several months. However, suffragettes were willing to go to prison, and some used hunger strikes as a powerful tool to protest their arrest and to demand the status of political suffragettes in custody. The Government’s response to hunger strikes were to force-feed those who participated, this involved individuals being strapped down and a tube unpleasantly forced down the throat or nostril to ensure that food could be pumped into the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-bg-image\">\r\n	<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/forcefeeding.jpg\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content visible no-padding\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:-30px;\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Forceful Feeding through the nose of women suffragists prisoners pronounced as dangerous by many leading members of the medical profession. \r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\nForce feeding suffragettes not only caused a public outcry, as forced feeding was traditionally used to feed criminal inmates, but the demeaning and dangerously invasive procedure damaged the long-term health of victims. For example, Lady Constance Lytton, who disguised herself as a ‘Jane Warton’ to gather evidence on differential treatment, was force-fed several times and never fully recovered from her ordeal. Lytton suffered a stroke in 1912 and died in 1923. This ultimately gained publicity for the women’s suffrage campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n        <p>I shall never while I live forget the suffering I experienced during </p> <p> the days when those cries were ringing in my ears </p> <small>EMMELINE PANKHURST</small>\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1913, with the motive of preventing suffragettes from dying as martyrs in police custody, the government introduced the Prisoners Temporary Discharge for Ill Health Act, commonly known as the ‘Cat and Mouse Act’. It was designed to provide for the release of suffragettes whose hunger strikes and forced feeding had brought them illness, as well as their arrest and re-imprisonment as soon as they had regained strength.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn response to the ‘Cat and Mouse Act’, Edith Garrud, who was one of the western world’s first female martial arts teachers, taught self-defence classes that protected women from being rearrested and sent back to jail. Garrud was known to protect prominent members, such as Emmeline Pankhurst. Members of Garrud’s classes orchestrated the \"escapes\" of several suffragettes from police surveillance during 1913 and early 1914. The \"Battle of Glasgow\" was one of the notable events in which suffragettes were violent with the police. This saw about thirty suffragettes clash with an estimated fifty police officers on the stage of St. Andrew\'s Hall in Glasgow, Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Cat-and-Mouse-Act.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       	The Cat and Mouse Act gained notoriety amongst women\'s suffrage organisations in the UK in the early 1910s\r\n        <span>\r\n			Photo: Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1> Emily Wilding Davidson: The \"Suffragette\" Derby </h1>\r\n\r\nOn 4th June 1913, the London born Emily Wilding Davidson, who had been arrested nine times and force-fed forty-nine times, decided to disrupt the Epsom Derby to draw attention to the women’s suffrage campaign. Davidson famously stepped out in front of Anmer, a horse owned by King George which resulted in her being knocked down. She died after four days due to a fractured skull and internal injuries. Owing to reports, it was not clear if she intended to kill herself for the cause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith a return train ticket and a ticket to a dance slated for the evening in her bag, reports suggested she possibly wanted to attach a WSPU banner to the horse’s bridle. Her death was iconic to the women’s suffrage campaign and she became a martyr to the cause. Thousands of women attended her funeral and lined the streets as her coffin was moved to its final resting place. She was laid to rest at Morpeth, Northumberland, and her grave was inscribed with the suffragette’s “Deeds Not Words” slogan.\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Emily.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/derby.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/emily-funeral.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; z-index: 99;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content no-padding visible\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper2\" align=\"left\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n        	<h3 style=\"padding: 0px;\r\n			font: normal 1.125em/1.1 GaramondPremrPro,serif;\r\n			line-height: 1.1;\r\n			position: relative;\r\n			top: -17px;\r\n			line-height: 6px;\"> <span class=\"slide-tracker\">1</span> of 3 </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10\" style=\"padding:0px;\">\r\n			<ul class=\"data-list\" style=\"min-height:20px; position: relative; left:-10px; min-height: 50px;\">\r\n				<li class=\"team-active default\">\r\n					In 1906, Emily Davison joined Emmeline Pankhurst\'s \"Women\'s Social Political Union (WSPU).

Therefore, on 6th February 1918, the Representation of the People Act was passed. This extended suffrage to men over the age of twenty-one (removing most property qualifications), British women over the age of 30 that were property owners, members of the local government register, and university graduates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn 21st November 1918, the Parliament (Qualification of Women Act) 1918 was passed. This allowed women to be elected to Parliament. The main reason for the age differential was to ensure that, following the loss of men in the war, women did not become the majority voters. Even though just over eight million women met this criterion, it only represented forty-percent of the total population of women in the nation. Furthermore, in 1928, the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act granted all women over the age of twenty-one voting rights. This was the first time that women had achieved electoral equality with men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/woman.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       	Finally in 1918, Parliament passed an act granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who were householders, the wives of householders, occupiers of property and graduates of British universities.

(13, 'The disease we today term “the plague” is caused by the Yersinia pestis bacteria and has three identified strains: bubonic plague (affecting the lymphatic system), pneumonic plague (affecting the lungs), and septicaemic plague (affecting the blood).\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBubonic plague is perhaps the most well-known strain as it refers specifically to the disease’s most infamous symptom; the bubo. This is an often-painful swelling of infected lymph nodes in the groin, neck or armpit. Other symptoms vary according to the specific strain of the plague, but if suffering from the disease today one can expect flu-like symptoms that may quickly become fatal if untreated.  This can, however, now be effectively treated with antibiotics and has a much higher survival rate than in previous centuries.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/First-plague-pit-image.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        This plague patient is displaying a swollen, ruptured inguinal lymph node, or buboe.

During the early modern period (approximately 1500 to 1750) it was known as the plague during various pandemics, but prior to this it was most often referred to as “the pestilence” by chroniclers.  We know this medieval outbreak as “the Black Death”, but this is also a modern term. It can confusingly imply two separate diseases rather than two separate outbreaks; however recent DNA testing of medieval Black Death victims has confirmed the presence of the plague-causing bacteria Yersinia pestis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe disease was caused by flea bites transferring the disease to rodents that arrived on Britain’s shores from plague-ridden countries. It was understood during the plague’s peak that these ships appeared to carry the plague but unclear as to how – the germ theory had not yet been formed. The best explanation of contagion during this period was known as “miasma”; the inhaling of toxic or infectious gases. The relative understanding of contagion led to the quarantining of certain ships for 40 days to ensure they were free from disease before coming to shore. The practice originated from medieval Venice, and comes from the Italian for “40 days”: quranta giorni.\r\n\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-bg-image\">\r\n	<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Yersinia-Perstis.jpg\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content visible no-padding\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:-30px;\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        A scanning electron micrograph depicting a mass of Yersinia pestis bacteria in the foregut of an infected flea.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n	<p> The victims ate lunch with their friends, and dinner with their ancestors in paradise </p> <small> Boccacio </small>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h1> How do we know about the early modern plague? </h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3> Bills of Mortality: </h3>\r\n\r\nThese are statistic reports produced to list numbers and causes of deaths in a specific area. Around plague pandemics similar publications known as the “Lord Have Mercy Upon Us” broadsheets were used specifically to communicate death tolls and other information on the plague around London. These publications demonstrate a rising culture of statistics around this period, possibly to install a sense of order around the rising panic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Figure below tells us that 3,880 people died from the plague between August 15th-22nd 1665 in this particular area of London. This accounts for a huge 73% of deaths in this specific week, giving us a rare statistic value of just how prevalent the disease was, and just how terrifying such a pandemic must have been in the absence of an effective treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Bill-of-Mortality.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        The Diseases and Casualties this Week, Bill of Mortality, 1665.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Welcome Collection / Accessed June 3rd 2018\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\nAside from important information on the plague, the Bills of Mortality also give us an invaluable insight into contemporary disease culture. Some conditions are recognisable, such as “Consumption” or “Scurvy”, but some we can only guess at, such as “Rising of the Lights”. Indeed, one poor person is simply listed to have died “Suddenly”. Do we even know that every listed death by “Plague” is the plague as we know it? Unfortunately, the answer is most likely no.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nCauses of death at this point were identified by “searchers” who did not have official medical training, but quickly checked corpses and passed the speculated cause of death on for the Bills of Mortality.  Despite uncertainty over disease identification, the value of the publication as a source through which to view the plague or other diseases is not diminished. It gives us a chance to view these conditions as they existed and affected the population in 1665 rather than comparing them to modern equivalents, or even wonder if there is a modern equivalent. Just because we can identify the plague by its name in the early modern period does not mean it was experienced in the same way as it is today, and the unidentifiable conditions on the Bills of Mortality remind us of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h1> Personal memoirs </h1>\r\n\r\nAs much as Bills of Mortality tell us about how many people died of the plague, they tell us virtually nothing of personal experiences. Unfortunately, a primary source with this type of information is extremely hard to come by; if a person experienced plague it is unlikely that they would be concerned with writing it down. Indeed, although literacy rates appear to have steadily increased over this period, the majority of the population were if not completely illiterate, then only capable of reading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n There are occasionally small glimpses of the disease within diaries kept at the time of the plague, but rarely at length. We see one of these in the writings of one of the most famous English diarists in history: Samuel Pepys.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Samuel.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Samuel Pepys was famous for the diary he kept for a decade while still a relatively young man. It provides a combination of personal revelation and eyewitness accounts of great events, such as the Great Plague of London.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough gaining fame for his account of the Great Fire of London, it is often forgotten that this event occurred around the same year as the final plague pandemic, 1665-66. Consequently, Pepys mentions his experiences with the plague but, as mentioned before, his lack of proximity is reflected in these experiences being limited to a line or two. On 14th September 1665 he wrote of one of these experiences:\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"side-note\">\r\n	 My meeting dead corpses of the plague, carried to be buried close to me at noonday through the City in Fanchurch Street. To see a person sick of the sores carried close by me by Gracechurch in a hackney-coach\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAlthough this seems to be a very limited excerpt, we can still learn several things from it. When looking specifically at plague pits, for example, the passage tells us that the dead were carried through Fanchurch Street (most likely modern-day Fenchurch Street, London, EC3M 4BS), meaning there may have been a burial pit nearby. As for contemporary symptoms, it tells us that the sores were possibly one of the most identifiable and diagnostic for the plague. The passage may be short, but is still an important piece of the puzzle.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h1>Medical/Supernatural Treatises </h1>\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of the plague in the 17th century led to many papers and reports being written on the disease by physicians, healers, supernaturalists and scientists alike (the distinctions between these different professions were much blurrier than they are today). These works were likely to be intended for circulation amongst the scholarly rather than for the general population; broadsheets tended to inform the literate masses, and ordinances from the monarch and reports from local councils were read out in public places for the rest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAstrologer John Gadbury published his musings on causes of plagues in 1665. His explanations had a mainly supernatural basis, as can be seen by his focus on the alignments of the planets, and concerned various major plague outbreaks that had occurred in history.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"side-note\">\r\n\r\nIn the year 1603, the Pestilence was inconsiderable in its increase, until the last week in June, and the month of July, at which times the fiery Planet Mars came to the opposite point of the Moon.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nGadbury’s discourse discusses the plague at length, and gives us some vague but usefully corroborative symptoms:\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"side-note\">\r\n\r\n“Physicians tell us, that the Plague is a disease most Malignant and Pestilential ; a Fever in the highest in the highest degree, which doth putrifie and corrupt, both the Solid and Fluid parts of the body ;  which have done, by an (almost) uncontrolable and unrepellable siccity, dries and destroys the Natural Powers, then seizeth or preyeth upon the vitals , and so lets in the everlasting Enemy, DEATH.”\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/John_Gadbury.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">Philosopher John Gadbury.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis particular source may seem somewhat indistinct and spiritual when attempting to piece together various bits of information on the physical aspects of the plague in history, such as its symptoms and how different geographical locations were affected. It is, however, still an extremely useful source; this is partly for the same reasons as the usefulness of the Bills of Mortality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nMuch in the same way the Bills of Mortality show us that individual experiences of historical disease may be so different from our modern ones that we are unable to properly empathise them, Gadbury’s treatise presents a valid contemporary view of the physical aspects of the plague that we may potentially find difficult to use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt demonstrates the inherent interlinking of natural and supernatural causes within disease culture at the time, as shown with the constant undertone of sin and judgement. Moreover, the significance of religion is made similarly obvious through this sinful narrative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe notion that supernatural explanations may be vital in understanding natural aspects of the plague can help us uncover details that may otherwise have gone unexplained if the focus were solely on modern interpretation of physical elements of the disease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis includes tiny details such as the layout and spacing of victims in a plague pit; the regular, careful positioning of the victims indicate that proper burials were vital even in densely filled plague pits, most likely because of the constant presence of religion and tradition, and the role of the parish.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h1> Official documents </h1>\r\n\r\nPlague pandemics tended to cause disorder, panic and subversions of social orders (given that no-one, not even those that were wealthier, were safe from the disease). Ordinances issued by the monarch can be seen as attempts to dampen this chaos through information and guidelines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nCharles II published “Rules and Orders” on the prevention of the plague in 1665 to control the contagious nature of the disease. The document is specifically for the instruction of “Justices of Peace, Mayors, Bayliffs, and other Officers”, i.e., those in charge of lay people.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Rules-and-Orders.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">Charles II, \"Rules and Orders\".\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: National Archives, Accessed June 12th 2018\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the document is not necessarily concerned with how an individual may protect him or herself from sickening, but how households, villages, etc, can protect themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt is a practical document, meaning we can see what details were deemed to be important enough to pass on from the highest-level authority to his subjects. We can see various historical concepts covered in other sources, such as:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Miasma (the belief that disease spread through bad-smelling air). Rules 6 & 7 dictate that “convenient Fumes to correct the Air be burnt” in public places, and that “no unwholsom Meats, stinking Fish, Flesh, musty Corn” may be sold.</li>\r\n	<li> Specific symptoms that searchers should look out for. Rule no. 10 dictates that local areas should be prepared to identify and care for the sick and that searchers should identify the plague by the “usual… Swellings or Risings under the Ears or Arm-pits [buboes], or upon the Groynes; Blains, Carbuncles, or little Spots, either on the Breast or back, commonly called Tokens.”</li>\r\n	<li>The significance of religion and the supernatural. As mentioned with regard to John Gadbury’s astronomical treatise on the plague, cures and explanations that we may think of spiritual rather than medical were used readily and expected to protect as effectively as any physical treatment. Rule no. 12 dictates that on any affected household undergoing quarantine should “have a Red Cross, and Lord have mercy upon us, in Capital Letter affixed on the door”.  That such a practical report would include such religious treatments against the plague again shows how these acts were as important at the time as those more medical, such as quarantine. The final line of the report asks that everyone take heed of these orders and maintain regular prayers and fasts in order to reverse God’s punishment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe report also gives us more information on the elusive plague pits. Rule no. 13 dictates where and how plague victims should be buried: \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<div class=\"side-note\">\r\n“in some other convenient place [than church yards], and that a good quantity of unslaked Lime be put into Graves with such bodies, and that such Graves be not after opened within the space of a year or more, less they infect others.”\r\n</div>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAlso mentioned in the orders, that we have not seen in aforementioned primary sources, is the first glimpses of the welfare state. Given the belief that sin and punishment were the major causes of the plague pandemic, the orders ensure that <b>“such visited poor may have sufficient Relief; want and nastiness being great occasions of the Infection.”</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nCoupled with the careful burials we see in plague pits, it can be ascertained that the plague may have fostered a culture of respect and care rather than one of isolation, which is often assumed from the fear of contagion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h1> Popular Literature </h1>\r\n\r\nOne of the most interestingly comprehensive overviews of the plague pandemic of 1665-6 comes from the author Daniel Defoe, in his novel entitled Journal of the Plague Year. The novel follows the main character, simply referred to as H. F., during the pandemic in London.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen compared to other primary sources used to understand the plague, Journal of the Plague Year certainly seems to corroborate. Defoe writes on the physical symptoms:\r\n\r\n<div class=\"side-note\">\r\n	“The swellings, which were generally in the neck or groin, when they grew hard and would not break, grew so painful that it was equal to the most exquisite torture; and some, not able to bear the torment, threw themselves out at windows”… “or otherwise made themselves away, and I saw several objects of that kind.”\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-bg-image\">\r\n	<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Plague-Victims.jpg\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content visible no-padding\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can liken this description of buboes to those given in other non-fiction sources, e.g., Charles II’s “Rules and Orders” and John Gadbury’s London’s deliverance predicted, being relatively detailed and graphic. This, however, also plays into the literary techniques of the novel, hence why it may be a slight exaggeration. To ‘make oneself away’ during this period, for example, literally meant to kill oneself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSuicide was seen as a religious crime against God – self-murder – and so whether this would have regularly occurred in a population readily believed to be being punished for their sins with the plague anyway, is debatable. It is due to these images of Defoe’s imagination within the text that it is unclear where it lies on the fiction/non-fiction spectrum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDespite Defoe’s guiding hand, the work is often read as non-fiction and used for various details on the physical aspects of the plague; online history guide Historic UK has used it as one of their sources to map the locations of various plague pits.  Indeed, Journal of the Plague Year references death tolls, burial registers and plague pits that, to a certain extent, do seem to be grounded in reality, as with his dimensions of the Aldgate plague pit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether we can cross-reference every detail given by Defoe on the plague, it provides an interesting contemporary popular view of how the disease was experienced. In other words, because the novel was written within living memory of plague year, Defoe would have had little reason to exaggerate or change objective details such as plague pit dimensions; these could easily have been checked. We can assume they are relatively accurate, and hence use it as the last important piece of the puzzle in the understanding of the early modern plague.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Plague Pits', '2018-08-05 7:52 pm', 'Plaque_Pits_Image.jpg', 'topics', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, NULL, 5),

Inside the building stands a poignant sight as seven 9ft tall bronze men form the centre piece of the monument. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memorial has been designed to be more than just another pretty London shrine; it’s primary purpose is to ensure there is a permanent tribute to the 55,573 Bomber Command servicemen who died in the defence of both the city and Britain.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Bomber_Command_Memorial_-_panoramio.jpg\" alt=\"Nature\" class=\"responsive\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>The Monument </h1>\r\nThe monument holds several interesting features – the first being the buildings open nature, ensuring the men are exposed to the sky, allowing light to cascade down and illuminate them. This clever blend of architecture and symbolism becomes even more powerful at night if visitors look up and spot the phrase “per ardua ad astra”. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Latin motto used by the RAF during the war translates as: “through adversity to the stars”. Another feature is the structure’s ceiling, constructed using salvaged sections of a Handley Page Halifax III aircraft used by Bomber Command. The plane in question was shot down over Belgium during an operation that cost the lives of eight crewmen on the 28th of May 1944. Its incorporation into the memorial adds a poignant connection to the past. \r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div>\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/London_RAF_Bomber_Command_Memorial.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/2013-05-12_London_RAF_Bomber_Command_Memorial.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/cieling.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute;

Around 1872, *Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud* ﬂed their native France to escape Verlaine’s wife and son and to embark upon what would become a volatile, torrid, and eventually life-threatening aﬀair. The exact location of this pub has been debated but the general consensus is that the Hibernia Stores on 5-7 Old Compton Street (now 23-25 Old Compton Street) was the setting for their frivolity.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTheir time in London clearly had a profound eﬀect on their literary works; many of the verses of Rimbaud’s Les Illuminations are set against the backdrop of the West End. In a way, the obscurity and hidden manner of Little Compton Street’s sign is a reﬂection and an ode to the forbidden nature of Rimbaud and Verlaine’s relationship. Bar Soho now stands in the place of the Hibernia Stores with revellers likely unaware that they follow in the drunken footsteps of illustrious French poets.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/800px-Henri_Fantin-Latour_-_By_the_Table_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Around 1872, Paul Verlaine (seated, far left) and Arthur Rimbaud (seated, second to left) ﬂed their native France to escape Verlaine’s wife and son and to embark upon what would become a volatile, torrid, and eventually life-threatening aﬀair.\r\nSource: Painting by Henri Fantin-Latour / Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\nA map dated March 1889, 16 years after the departure of Rimbaud and Verlaine, detail the layout of the miniature street.

(19, 'In an area of open parkland in the south-east corner of Hampstead Heath in north-west London there is still a strong feeling of being very much a part of countryside. And yet, when standing at the viewpoint of Parliament Hill there is this sudden shift of being miles away from the big city. Approximately 6 miles out of the city of London the 791-acre heath, which is an amalgam of the grounds of several large houses that were once in the area, is the summit of Parliament Hill which provides a fantastic view towards London and is a focal point for locals and visitors alike. \r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-bg-image\">\r\n	<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Parliament-Hill-hiddenhistory-london.jpg\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content visible no-padding\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>The Land</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nIt has been long suspected that the mound on top of the hill was a Bronze Age (2500 until c. 800 BC) burial barrow. The hill itself was part of a manor in 1133 during Henry I reign. He decided to give the land to Baron Richard de Balta. A grant was confirmed by Westminster to Richard de Balta of ‘land of the fee of Westminster of Hampstead’ for rent of two pounds a year. This also included Abbot William de Humez (1214-22) being assigned the two-pound rent ‘from the manor of Hampstead’ to the abbey’s kitchen. It’s not clear if the grant was of the whole manor or of the estate within it. During Henry II reign the manor appears to have been passed onto Alexander de Barentyn who was the King’s butler. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAs time went on the plots of land in the manor were sold off. Especially in the early 19th century. Although the hill remained mainly common land, The Metropolitan Board of Works (which was created to help provide infrastructure to cope with London’s rapid growth) acquired Hampstead Heath for the people in 1875, which didn’t include Parliament Hill. Thirteen years later Parliament Hill was added to Hampstead heath for £300,000. The Manorial rights of the land remained in private hands until the mid-20th century. The manorial rights lapsed under Sir Spencer Pocklington Maryon Wilson. Though the estate itself was purely a formal position without any real power. It was then passed on to Shane Gough, 5th Viscount Gough. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n</div></div></div></div></div>\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Parliament_Hill_london.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Parliament_Hill_during_sunset.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Parliament_Hill_romantic_scene.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; z-index: 99;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content no-padding visible\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper2\" align=\"left\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n        	<h3 style=\"padding: 0px;\r\n			font: normal 1.125em/1.1 GaramondPremrPro,serif;\r\n			line-height: 1.1;\r\n			position: relative;\r\n			top: -17px;\r\n			line-height: 6px;\"> <span class=\"slide-tracker\">1</span> of 3 </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10\" style=\"padding:0px;\">\r\n			<ul class=\"data-list\" style=\"min-height:20px; position: relative; left:-10px; min-height: 50px;\">\r\n				<li class=\"team-active default\">\r\n					Parliament Hill is an area of open parkland in the south-east corner of Hampstead Heath in north-west London.

The cattle were reared to be sold through Smithfields the London meat market up until the 1940’s. The grass there today is bred farm grasses, which just shows a legacy from a time when the heath was an agricultural resource. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGreater London Council managed Parliament Hill, which, was then taken over by Camden Council until 1989 when the City of London Corporation took ownership. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>What’s in the Name?</h3>\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, long before Parliament Hill got its name it was referred to as Traitors Hill, possibly due to it being an execution site. A legend states that the hill is connected with the Gunpowder plot to blow up Parliament. <mark>It’s believed that Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby planned to watch Parliament being destroyed from the top of the hill on the 5th of November 1605.</mark> As intriguing as this is, especially in relation to the name Traitors Hill, the theory is unsubstantiated.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was also suggested that the name Traitors Hill came about in the mid-17th century during the English Civil War. Troops loyal to Parliament would occupy the hill. With the modern houses of Parliament seen from the viewpoint, those who were against King Charles I and his views on the Irish insurrection would use the hill as a point of defence. It isn’t clear, if the name changed during the civil war or after but the name ‘Parliament Hill’ did come into existence. \r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-bg-image\">\r\n	<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Gunpowder_Plot_conspirators_hidden_history.jpg\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content visible no-padding\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>It’s not just about the View.</h3>\r\n\r\nParliament Hill is best known for its viewpoint at the top. Measuring 98.1 metres (322 ft) high, providing beautiful views across London. The view, which can be captured in one panorama, is one of three viewing locations on Hampstead heath that has been identified in Greater London Authority\'s London View Management Framework. This is in recognition of the significant views towards St Pauls Cathedral and Victoria Tower at the Palace of Westminster. The viewpoint is also at times referred to as “kite hill” due to the popularity of flying kites on a sunny day. However, there is more to the area then meets the eye. Parliament Hill not only has some key landmarks but also holds various sporting events. It is also home to a flock of Flamingos.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/a_boy_flies_a_kite_on_parliament_hill.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        A boy flies a kite on the summit of Parliament Hill, Hampstead Heath.

The pool turned 80 years old in 2018 and is popular with locals as a place to exercise or just cool off in an outdoor pool. On the 20th of August 1938 the now Grade II-listed Lido was opened. At the time it was the most expensive of the 13 outdoor pools in London County Council that was built between 1920 and the outbreak of the Second World War. When it originally opened diving-boards adorned its sides as well as a slide. However, today the offering is more simplistic. In 1990 Historic England listed the lido under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2005 the Lido underwent an extensive refurbishment. It now boasts a new stainless-steel liner (the only one of its kind in an outdoor pool in the UK) and reflective qualities that not only help retain heat, but also gives the water an extra shimmer. The pool isn’t just for families and wetsuit-clad fitness fiends, the lido will also be used for forthcoming triathlons. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n</div></div></div></div></div>\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Parliament_Hill_lido_hidden_history_london_3.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Parliament_Hill_lido_hidden_history_london_2.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Parliament_Hill_lido_hidden_history_london.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; z-index: 99;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content no-padding visible\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper2\" align=\"left\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n        	<h3 style=\"padding: 0px;\r\n			font: normal 1.125em/1.1 GaramondPremrPro,serif;\r\n			line-height: 1.1;\r\n			position: relative;\r\n			top: -17px;\r\n			line-height: 6px;\"> <span class=\"slide-tracker\">1</span> of 3 </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10\" style=\"padding:0px;\">\r\n			<ul class=\"data-list\" style=\"min-height:20px; position: relative; left:-10px; min-height: 50px;\">\r\n				<li class=\"team-active default\">\r\n					By August 1938 the now Grade II-listed Lido was the most expensive of the 13 outdoor pools in London County Council that was built between 1920 and the outbreak of the Second World War.\r\n					<span>Photography: John Weller (Wild Swimming Spain)</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					The pool isn’t just for families and wetsuit-clad fitness fiends, the lido will also be used for forthcoming triathlons. <span>\r\n					Source: Wikimedia Commons </span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					Built in 1938 and Grade II-listed, this is the only stainless steel lined outdoor pool in the country.

The bandstand that stands today was actually built in the 1990’s as the original was rundown. The original however, was based on the other side of Kite Hill on the banks of Highgate Ponds in the early 1900’s. The Bandstand was the subject of many attractive posters and black and white snapshots, which proved that the spot was quite the tourist attraction and as a place to see and be seen.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday’s bandstand can be found next to the Farmers Markets and Cricket ground. The current design is based on the original. There is no particular record of when the original and sizeable circular seating area around disappeared from Parliament Hill Fields, however there was a post-war carbuncle that was certainly in operation in the current location from the 1950’s.\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/bandstand_at_parliament_hill_hidden_history.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        The bandstand that stands today was actually built in the 1990’s as the original was rundown.\r\nSource: Julian Osley / Bandstand, Parliament Hill Fields\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\nIn the late 1960’s Camden Council organised a series of free concerts at the bandstand. Beginning in September 1968, on a rainy Wednesday the Jefferson Airplane and Fairport Convention played to only a few hundred tuned-in people. The following summer the council progressed their free Camden Festival concept further by putting on three weekly parties throughout May. The first band to perform at the festival was Pink Floyd. The band were squeezed into the corrugated iron shed while battling the feedback from their PA. <br /> <br /><mark>The following week the crowd doubled in size.</mark> This was partly due to John Peel mentioning the events on his radio shows and by week three Fleetwood Mac played with 25,000 people turning up. Sadly, Fleetwood Mac only played a couple of songs before being forced off the stage due to a group of people causing trouble. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn recent years more celebrities have brought attention to the bandstand. In 2006 Booker Prize-winning local author Alan Hollinghurst fought a long and ultimately fruitless battle to have a programme of Sunday afternoon brass, jazz and Japanese music performed at the bandstand blocked. The grounds of the “intolerable noise nuisance” ABBA’s Benny Anderson also brought international attention to the bandstand by performing some of the pop classics he penned in a ‘comeback gig’ as part of a Swedish cultural celebration. \r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-bg-image\">\r\n	<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Parliament_Hill_hiddenhistory_london_bandstand.jpg\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content visible no-padding\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<br />\r\nTo hear more about the Pink Floyd gig ‘The Archive’ has documented stories of those who were present which, can be accessed <a href=\"http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/pinkfloyd5-9-69.html\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a>\r\nThe bandstand today is a focal point for a lot of the Heath events and like previous generations of school kids it is still a popular meeting spot during the week.

Beside the cricket pitch is the Parliament Hill London Farmers Market, which is open every Saturday from 10am-2pm. On the other side there is an adventure playground for the kids. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParliament Hill is one of the focal points of Hampstead Heath overall and provides Londoners a small piece of the countryside while living in the capital city. There are even parts of the hill that are still unmown in the summer which are crisscrossed by a network of pathways. Parliament Hill can be seen as a less popular place to visit compared to other sites, however, it provides a natural haven to north Londoners and its history is rich for those who wish to seek it.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Parliament Hill', '2019-02-26 3:39 pm', 'Parliament-Hill.jpg', 'topics', '51.5596682', '-0.1618931', 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, NULL, NULL),

He, like many wealthy people in the late Victorian period, believed in the need for social reform for the poor in England, and in turn saw a need to actively remember the heroism of ‘ordinary’ people. In his letter he wrote:\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<mark> “The character of a nation as a people of great deeds is one, it appears to me, that should never be lost sight of. It must surely be a matter of regret when names worthy to be remembered and stories stimulating and instructive are allowed to be forgotten… It is not too much to say that the history of Her Majesty’s reign would gain a lustre were the nation to erect a monument, say, here in London, to record the names of these likely to be forgotten heroes”. <small> George Frederic Watts</small>\r\n</mark>\r\n \r\n<br>\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-bg-image\">\r\n	<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/George_Frederic_Watts\'s_Memorial_to_Heroic_Self_Sacrifice.jpg\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content visible no-padding\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite this initial suggestion for the memorial, it wasn’t officially opened until 30 July 1900. In 1898, Watts was invited by the vicar of St Botolph’s church – the space being their former churchyard – to create the monument in the now public park. So, in 1899 the construction began of the 50ft long 9ft high shelter by J. Simpson and Son for the tablets at the cost of £402. Benches were also installed to encourage the public to stay a little longer. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpace was made available for 120 tablets (in rows of 24), though only 54 tablets have been installed so far. Each tablet is made up of small tiles and records the name(s) of the deceased with the details and date of the events making them worthy of remembrance. Only 4 of these plaques were installed when the monument was opened. The remainder of the first row included 9 installed in 1902, and 11 more along with T. H. Wren’s memorial to Watts in 1905 following his death the year before. All 24 of these tablets were designed by the ceramicist William De Morgan. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-bg-image\">\r\n	<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Postman\'s_Park_Wall_of_Heroes.jpg\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content visible no-padding\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<br />\r\nA further 29 tablets were designed by Royal Doulton, 24 of which were installed altogether in 1908 filling a second row. Another 5 Doulton-style tablets were added on the next row from 1919-1930, which included replacement of a De Morgan tablet with incorrect information. A further tablet in the original De Morgan style created by Fred Passenger was slotted into the old spot for the incorrect tablet in 1931. Finally, the 54th tablet was added much later in 2009, commemorating Leigh Pitt who died saving a boy from drowning in 2007.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nOne of the people featured in the memorial is Alice Ayres, who died in 1885 while trying to save three children under her care from an upper-story of a burning house. Two of the three children survived, and Alice died in the process of trying to save herself as she fell awkwardly after jumping out the window. She was one of the most famous additions to the memorial and had already been commemorated in other ways across the country around the time of her death – this included in memorials, artwork and a street was renamed after her near to where she died on Union Street in 1936. Her name was also used as an alias in the play (and 2004 film) Closer.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/alice-ayres.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/alice-ayres-memorial-tablet.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/ayres-street.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"3\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/London-fire-brigade.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"4\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Closer-alice-ayres-hidden-history.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; z-index: 99;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content no-padding visible\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper2\" align=\"left\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n        	<h3 style=\"padding: 0px;\r\n			font: normal 1.125em/1.1 GaramondPremrPro,serif;\r\n			line-height: 1.1;\r\n			position: relative;\r\n			top: -17px;\r\n			line-height: 6px;\"> <span class=\"slide-tracker\">1</span> of 5 </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10\" style=\"padding:0px;\">\r\n			<ul class=\"data-list\" style=\"min-height:20px; position: relative; left:-10px; min-height: 50px;\">\r\n				<li class=\"team-active default\">\r\n					Alice Ayres (pictured above) was an English nursemaid honoured for her bravery in rescuing the children in her care from a house fire. \r\n\r\n					<span>Source: Wikimedia Commons.</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>\r\n					Alice Ayres\'s memorial tablet, designed by William De Morgan and added to the Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice in 1902\r\n					<span>\r\n					 Source: Wikimedia Commons.</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>In 1936 the new Labour administration of the London County Council renamed White Cross Street, near the scene of the Union Street fire, to Ayres Street in tribute to Alice Ayres, a name it retains today.\r\n					<span>Source: Wikimedia Commons.</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>The Chandlers\' house at 194 Union Street no longer stands, and the site is occupied by part of the Union House office complex; immediately opposite the site of the fire is the present-day headquarters of the London Fire Brigade.\r\n					<span>Source: Wikimedia Commons.</span>\r\n				</li>\r\n				<li>In the movie, Closer, Jude Law and Natalie Portman\'s characters visit the park.

(21, 'Nelson’s death at Trafalgar secured his position as one of Britain’s most heroic figures. His signal “England expects that every man will do his duty” has been regularly quoted, paraphrased and referenced right up to the modern day. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is because of that, that Admiral Nelson has had numerous monuments erected in his honour cementing not only his memory but also his legacy. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Horatio_Nelson_painting_hidden_history_uk.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson was a British flag officer in the Royal Navy. He was noted for his inspirational leadership, grasp of strategy, and unconventional tactics, which together resulted in a number of decisive British naval victories, particularly during the Napoleonic Wars.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBorn Horatio Nelson on the 29th September 1758 in Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk, he was the 6th of 11 children of a clergyman. Joining the navy at the tender age of 12, he moved swiftly through the ranks and became Captain at 20. Nelson saw service in the West Indies, the Baltic region and Canada. In 1787 he married Frances Nisbet in Nevis. Once he returned to England with his bride however, he spent the next 5 years on half-pay, frustrated at the lack of a command. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt wasn’t until 1793, when Britain entered the French Revolutionary Wars that Nelson was given command of HMS Agamemnon, a 64-gun third-rate ship of the line of the British Royal Navy.  He served in the Mediterranean, assisted capturing Corsica and saw battle a Calvi where he lost the sight in his right eye. In 1797 in the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife he lost his right arm.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nNelson was well known for his bold action and at times, disregard of orders given from his superiors. It is this disregard for orders which brought him victories against the Spanish off Cape Vincent in 1797 and in The Battle of Copenhagen four years later. His excuse for not ceasing fire when ordered, was due to the fact that he put his telescope to his blind eye and subsequently claimed he did not see the signal to withdraw.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/The_Battle_of_the_Nile.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        The Destruction of L\'Orient at the Battle of the Nile\"\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<mark>In 1798 at the Battle of the Nile, Nelson successfully destroyed Napoleon’s fleet and thus his bid for a direct trade route to India.</mark> His next posting was in Naples where he ended up falling in love with Emma, Lady Hamilton. Both considered each other soul mates but they remained in their respective marriages. They had a child named Horatia, in 1801. It was in the same year that Nelson was promoted to Vice-Admiral.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNelson’s leadership from 1794 to 1805 saw the Royal Navy prove its supremacy over the French. The most famous engagement, at Cape Trafalgar, saved Britain from the threat of invasion by Napoleon. Before the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805 Nelson sent out the famous signal to his fleet <mark>“England expects that every man will do his duty”.</mark> \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few hours later while leading the attack on the combined French and Spanish fleet a musket shot fired from the fighting top of the French ship Redoubtable badly wounded him.  Three hours later he passed away from his wound. Once the battle was over his body was preserved in brandy while heading back to England where he was given a state funeral.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nTo read in more detail about the Battle of Trafalgar please go to the British Battles website.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/fall_of_nelson_horatio_Battle_of_Trafalgar_hh_hidden_history_london.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Painter Denis Dighton\'s imagining of Nelson being shot on the quarterdeck of Victory.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>The Monument</h3>\r\nTaking centre stage in Trafalgar Square Nelson’s Column towers at 18 ft. 1 in (5.5m). Nelson’s Column was built between 1840 and 1843, after William Railton won a protracted competition to design the structure. The original decision to award Railton the contract was overturned, but his design emerged triumphant in the re-run. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther changes included the monument being built entirely out of sandstone. However, this plan changed shortly before construction started. William used Dartmoor granite, which brought the total weight of the statue to approximately 2,500 tonnes.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"picture-carousel\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0;\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-wrapper-inner slider\" data-loadend=\"slidetracker()\">\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"0\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/nelson\'s_column_slide1_hidden_history_london.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n	\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"1\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/nelson\'s_column_under_construction_hidden_history_london.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n	<div class=\"div\" data-team-id=\"2\">\r\n		<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/nelson\'s_column_close_up_hidden_history_london.jpg\">\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- controls -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; z-index: 99;\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-arrow-box\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/arrow-down.png\" >\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"about-page contents article-info-list2 visible\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-8 team-info article-content no-padding visible\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper2\" align=\"left\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n        	<h3 style=\"padding: 0px;\r\n			font: normal 1.125em/1.1 GaramondPremrPro,serif;\r\n			line-height: 1.1;\r\n			position: relative;\r\n			top: -17px;\r\n			line-height: 6px;\"> <span class=\"slide-tracker\">1</span> of 3 </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10\" style=\"padding:0px;\">\r\n			<ul class=\"data-list\" style=\"min-height:20px; position: relative; left:-10px; min-height: 50px;\">\r\n				<li class=\"team-active default\">\r\n					Nelson’s Column cost £47,000 to built in the 1840s, which is the equivalent of between £3 million and £4 million today.

The original proposal was for a 203ft (62m) column, however, due to concerns over the stability and cost the construction plans were scaled back. Robert Peel the then-prime minister stated that it would be ‘extremely inconvenient should the monument fall in that crowded part of the metropolis.” But the height of the column changed again in 2006 when it was discovered the structure was 169 feet - roughly 16 foot smaller than what everyone had thought. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince its construction there have been numerous people who have climbed the column. The first was in the 1840’s when the 14 stonemasons who were responsible for hoisting the statue onto the top of the column made sure that they had a dinner party on the pedestal before they finished placing the statue. Throughout the years countless stunt people and political activists have climbed the column. An anti-apartheid campaigner climbed the column in the 1970s and more recently, Greenpeace protesters managed to fix a dust mask to Nelson’s face to highlight their concerns about air pollution. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/nelson-statue.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Close up shots of the statue.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe reason for the statue of Nelson himself facing down Whitehall, towards the admiralty is that he ultimately is looking in the direction of Cape Trafalgar in southern Spain. A reminder to all that it was he who ensured victory over Napoleon. The Admiral sculpture itself is actually smaller than people believe. French sightseers in the early days were said to be delighted that the statue actually depicted Napoleon. Up close the statue itself reflects how Horatio Nelson appeared in later life with just one arm and one eye. There were fears that the remaining arm would be lost after a lightning strike in 1896, brass straps were affixed and stayed there for a century. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterestingly, the Nazis loved Nelson’s Column as a big, powerful monument symbolizing imperial conquest. The German Luftwaffe were even ordered not to bomb the Column as they hoped to move it to Berlin if they won the Second World War. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2006 the Column was refurbished at a cost of approximately £420,000, which was considerably more, then the initial outlay. It was actually during these renovations that the monument was found to be shorter than first thought.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Trafalgar-Square-2.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        The column looking south towards Whitehall and the Palace of Westminster.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Medals and Titles Awarded</h3>\r\n\r\nNelson’s titles were inscribed on his coffin and were read out at the funeral by Garter King at Arms, Sir Isaac Heard. They were: The Most Noble Lord Horatio Nelson, Viscount and Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, Baron Nelson of the Nile and of Hilborough in the said County, Knight of the Most Honourable Order of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, Vice Admiral of the White Squadron of the Fleet, Commander and Chief of his Majesty’s Ships and Vessels in the Mediterranean, Duke Bronté in the Kingdom of Sicily, Knight Grand Cross of the Sicilian Order of St Ferdinand and of Merit, Member of the Ottoman Order of the Crescent and Knight Grand Commander of the Order of St Joachim.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdmiral Nelson also received large naval Gold medals for the battles of St. Vincent, the Nile and posthumously, Trafalgar. Nelson was the only recipient of three such medals. \r\nAdmiral Nelson received the General Service Medal (1793-1840) with the clasp “Trafalgar” in 1847 along with members of the crews - who were still alive and able to apply for the medal - of the British ships at the Battle of Trafalgar. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Tomb_of_Horatio_Nelson_on_Saint-Paul_Cathedral.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Tomb of Horatio Nelson at Saint Paul Cathedral.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile as a Colonel of the Royal Marines from 1795 to 1797 he was voted a Freeman of the cities and boroughs of Bath, Salisbury, Exeter, Plymouth, Monmouth, Sandwich, Oxford, Hereford and Worcester. On the 30 July 1802, The University of Oxford, in full Congregation, bestowed an honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law upon Nelson.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKing Ferdinand created Nelson Duke of Bronte of the Kingdom of Sicily in July 1799. After experimenting with the signature “Bronte Nelson of the Nile”, he signed himself “Nelson & Bronte” for the rest of his life. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNelson died without any legitimate children. The titles “of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk” became extinct upon his death. However, in 1801 the barony created “of the Nile and of Hilborough in the County of Norfolk” which passed by a special remainder and included Nelson’s father and sisters and their male issue, to the Reverend William Nelson, Nelson’s older brother. William Nelson was created Earl Nelson and Viscount Merton, of Trafalgar and Merton in the county of Surrey in November 1805. This was in recognition of his late brother’s services. He also inherited the dukedom of Bronte.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/NelsonTomb.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Arrival of Admiral Lord Nelson\'s funeral carriage for internment at St. Paul\'s Cathedral, London.

However, their creation was plagued with delays and prevarication. The lions were intended to be in stone or granite roughly 20 feet long. The idea wasn’t met with universal agreement. John Graham Lough was originally asked to be the sculptor, but due to the lack of funding and various artistic arguments prevented their execution at the same time as the erection of the monument. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe issue dragged on until 1846 when enough funds finally became available to commission the four bas-reliefs at the base of the column. 12 years later in 1858 the House of Commons allocated £6000 for the lions to be completed. The plan was to invite six sculptors to submit models for one to be selected. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/lions-nelson.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Two of the Lions designed by Sir Edwin Landseer\'s (English painter and Sculpturer) that guard the outside diagonals of Nelson\'s Column.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Flickr\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the Board of Works had very different intentions. They announced the appointment of Sir Edwin Landseer. This appointment raised eyebrows as although Landseer was well known for his paintings of animals, which included stags and dogs and was favoured by Queen Victoria (he was commissioned to paint her and her family), his skills and knowledge of sculpture was questionable. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Times newspaper at the time wrote that while acknowledging his skill at painting, they observed that <mark>“Sir Edwin never had a chisel in his hand in his life, and never yet, we believe, attempted to model anything.”</mark>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther delays were caused by Landseer’s ill health and financial problems. While newspapers referred to ‘a scandal’ and ‘national disgrace’, and the lions became the subject of jokes and questions were asked in parliament. Confusion over the costs didn’t help, as an additional £11,000 was required for their casting. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the 31st of January 1867, the bronze lions were finally unveiled in Trafalgar Square. Ironically ‘The Times’ - which had been rather scathing a few years earlier - was full of praise for the lions. However, some critics disliked them. Reynolds Newspaper wrote “Although admirable in most respects, has certainly some glaring defects”. There was this belief that their character was more like a sphinx than a lion. Other critics, however, were just thankful that the whole affair was finally over. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/lions-at-the-base.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       The Lions at the Base of the Nelson Column, Trafalgar-Square.

However, the damage had already been long since done. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of Bloody Sunday the PIRA ratcheted up its armed campaign, undoubtedly rejuvenated by a raft of new recruits who had been horrified by the actions of the British Army. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the Official IRA beat their former partners to the punch with a deadly attack on a military barracks in the Aldershot area of England only a few weeks after Bloody Sunday, it would not take the PIRA long to join in too.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the 8th of March 1973 the PIRA retaliated in full force with its first operation in England, killing one person and injuring 265 others with car bombs in London, an attack that was a deadly first blow and a sign of things to come for the British capital.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/The-scene-after-an-IRA-bomb-Old-Bailey.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        The scene after an IRA bomb exploded outside the Old Bailey in central London in 1973 which killed one person and injured 200 people.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many ways Bloody Sunday acted as the perfect justification for the PIRA to target London and reinforced the ideologies they already held. Innocent civilians had been killed by the British army and demand for retaliation against the establishment on the British mainland was high within the PIRA. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>Why target London? </h1>\r\n\r\nFor the PIRA, the start of the bombing campaign in London was about more than just getting revenge. An assault on the capital made sense from a strategic point of view as there were several crucial ways in which attacks on the city were able to help advance their agenda. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn short, by expanded their bombing campaign, the PIRA believed they would create the three elements necessary to facilitate the creation of a free united Ireland: fear, support, and pressure. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirstly, it brought the war out of its Irish confines, and directly onto the streets of England, thus creating fear. The support would be created because it also provided an opportunity for the group to generate more exposure through propaganda. Pressure would also be created through the general public’s fear, and the significant damage to the UK economy the campaign would cause. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Wormwood-Street-London-Irish-Republican-Army.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        The Bishopsgate bombing which occurred on 24 April 1993.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe support part of this plan might seem unusual for a paramilitary force, but as a relatively small group the PIRA needed to publicise itself and its mission. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ranks of the organisation were made up of volunteer recruits, therefore successful operations in London - one of the most famous cities in the world - naturally acted as the perfect advert to attract new members. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore importantly than this though was the fact the PIRA, at least in the initial phases of the Troubles, had a small support base in the UK it believed it could tap into. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/resistance-ira.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        The murals of Falls Road in West Belfast in Northern Ireland.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Flickr\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish backing for the Republicans can be bizarrely exemplified by John Lennon, who amongst penning a song entitled ‘Sunday Bloody Sunday’, also appeared at a London protest march in 1972 carrying a sign inscribed with the words: ‘For the IRA against British Imperialism.’ \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTommy McKearney, a former member of the PIRA explains in his book that, <mark>‘it seemed to many Irish Republicans that only by detonating explosives in England would they keep the British population aware of what their government was doing.’</mark>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe rationale behind this was that hitting London would generate headline news stories about the Troubles on an international level, the publicity it got would highlight the groups plight and in turn generate more support like that seen at the solidarity marches. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnder a presumed mountain of pressure from supporters and those also reacting in fear, the British government would eventually be forced to withdraw the UK from Northern Ireland.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis master plan was too naïve and failed to achieve the PIRA’s desired results, the government stood strong on the topic for the duration of the conflict. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/john-lennon.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        John Lennon at a London protest march in 1972 carrying a sign.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe group also never received the level of public backing it needed, the Troubles coincided with a difficult period of history for the British working-class, who were naturally too preoccupied with more pressing domestic issues. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA fourth element that influenced the PIRA’s decision to divert some of their attention across the Irish Sea, was the fact it gave the group the opportunity to attack softer targets. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe success the group had enjoyed in Northern Ireland had proven to be a double-edged sword, as the security forces that opposed them had been forced to up their game. In comparison, London - and other locations on the UK mainland - were less prepared, more vulnerable and now viable targets.  \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite being on home ground in Northern Ireland, the PIRA was also unable to fully get the upper hand on the British Armed Forces and Royal Ulster Constabulary, who thanks to superior numbers and resources, were able to establish a foothold in the region. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis therefore put the IRA Army Council (the decision-making body of the PIRA) in a difficult position and forced it to look elsewhere for opportunities to strike at its opponents. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<!-- Copy & Pasted from YouTube -->\r\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZCF8OREz9A?start=100\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n<div class=\"caption\">\r\n        A collection of news reports from Thames News detailing the IRA\'s attacks and events in London throughout the period of The Troubles. \r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Thames News\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n\r\n\r\nOperations on the British mainland and London in particular became a viable alternative for this reason as they made sense from a military perspective. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe city, despite being 500 miles away from the PIRA’s South Armagh heartland, was less secure and prepared for attacks at that time, and was consequently the perfect place to initiate a guerrilla warfare-based campaign against the British establishment. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAcross the entirety of the Troubles fifteen British Army personnel lost their lives during the PIRA’s coordinated assaults on London’s military establishments.  What is alarming to consider is the fact that the majority of these people were actually killed on just one fatal day. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the 20th of July 1982 PIRA were able to detonate two bombs within a couple of hours of each other in Hyde Park and Regents Park. These places of natural beauty quickly became more reminiscent of a battlefield as eleven soldiers and seven military horses lost their lives in the blasts. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe assaults were so successful because the PIRA had opportunistically taken advantage of the more relaxed atmosphere of the city. The eleven soldiers killed had been conducting their daily duties, in full display of the general public. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe four lost in Hyde Park had been conducting the daily Changing of the Guard, while the seven killed in Regents Park had been performing music from Oliver!. Despite being in the middle of a bloody conflict both of the events had still been advertised to the public, and were consequently ripe for the PIRA to target.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe PIRA made no attempt to hide why it chose to attack London, in the groups various <mark>‘Green Book’</mark> induction manuals it explicitly laid out a list of strategy guidelines for new recruits to adhere to. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe opening bullet point makes direct reference to the ideas we have already explored, stating all IRA attacks were part of; ‘A War of attrition against enemy personnel which is aimed at causing as many casualties and deaths as possible so as to create a demand from their people at home for their withdrawal.’ \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/greennbook.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        The Green Book is a training and induction manual issued by the Irish Republican Army to new volunteers.

The car bomb, a sinister staple of their arsenal that was used in attacks such as the one in Hyde Park in 1982 and was often rigged with a timer or remote control detonator, eventually gave way to the much more destructive fertiliser bomb. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/hyde-park-deaths.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Carcasses of horses of the Household Cavalry lie in the road following the Hyde Park bomb attack \r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Corbis // Independent.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSix attacks carried out towards the end of the conflict in the 1990s that used these new weapons have been cited by historians such as Paul Rogers as a marked beginning of a new phase in the war, and perfectly demonstrate the phenomenon of weapon development in action. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Baltic exchange attack on the 10th of April 1992 - the first lorry based fertiliser bomb attack on the British mainland – was at that time the biggest detonation in London since the Luftwaffe’s assaults during the Second World War, scarily it was trumped again almost exactly a year later. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Bishopsgate attack on the 24th of April 1993 saw the deployment of a massive 1 tonne ANFO bomb, a tool originally conceived to clear large areas of space in heavy industries such as mining. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo put that into perspective, a regular car bomb like the one used in the Harrods attack in 1983 often weighed around 30lb, a mere fraction compared to the 2204lb bomb that was unleashed a decade later. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe fallout from the Bishopsgate blast was so devastating that a large mushroom cloud billowed out above the 15-foot wide crater that had been left behind in the spot where the vehicle had once stood, photos of the devastation taken in the immediate aftermath of the destruction also bare a haunting similarity to those taken during the height of the Blitz.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/bishopgate-bombing.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        The fallout from the Bishopsgate blast was so devastating\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: City of London Police.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 1993 attack on Bishopsgate would also hold the unsavoury record of being the single most financially costly attack in world history for a considerable amount of time, with the estimated £1 billion worth of damage only being surpassed by the September 11th attacks on the United States in 2001.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe PIRA never stood still during the Troubles, to effectively wage its war against the British establishment it was essential for the group to be resourceful, the relentless development and evolution of their weapons being the ultimate showcase of this. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe pace at which they continued to break new ground was remarkable, with this arms race there naturally came an increased sense of boldness. Political assassinations were frequently attempted or enacted by the PIRA, as was the case in 1979 when Queen Elizabeth II’s cousin Lord Louis Mountbatten had been killed. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, thanks to their weaponry they audaciously came within touching distance of completing one of their main objectives in 1991. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 7th of February of that year could have easily gone down in British history as a day of infamy, as on that specific Thursday, the IRA chose to deploy a carefully prepared mortar attack on 10 Downing Street, the very heart of British politics. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/downing_st_mortar.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Mortar attack on 10 Downing street.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThree giant 4 ½ foot long shells were propelled towards a packed Cabinet meeting from a homemade mortar, which had been stored in the back of a modified Ford Transit van. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe projectiles would ultimately fail to meet their mark and subsequently dealt minimal damage, the nearest shell would however, fall a mere 30 metres away from the entirety of the British Cabinet. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe event was still a landmark occasion, whilst mortars had been used frequently in Northern Ireland this instance was the first recorded deployment of such a weapon on English soil. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Real Irish Republican Army, an offshoot of the PIRA formed following the Good Friday Agreement, would continue to break historic new ground in a similar fashion to its forbearer on the 20th of September 2000, when a RPG-22 anti-tank rocket was launched harmlessly at the headquarters of MI6. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h3> The consequences of the London attacks </h3>\r\nThere can be no real debate that the biggest consequence of the PIRA’s long reign of terror in London was a tragic list of casualties. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe groups staunch commitment to their mission and ability to deploy sophisticated weapons meant that forty-eight men and women were killed in the city across the entirety of the conflict.  Twenty-eight of these victims, a clear majority, were unarmed innocent civilians going about their daily lives. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to the fifteen soldiers we previously talked about in this article, it should also not be forgotten that five members of the Metropolitan Police Force were also killed as they actively sought to keep the population of the capital safe. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Bombing-in-Belfast.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        \r\n        <span>\r\n			\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though the PIRA never explicitly declared any desire to kill members of the public, some historians have suggested it is doubtful that they were naive enough to believe their attacks posed no threat to their lives. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA regular element of their attacks on the city’s businesses was the issuing of an indirect coded warning to the police, even in circumstances where these messages were received a subsequent successful evacuation was still never guaranteed. As was the case of an attack on the 9th of February 1996 when two civilians were killed by a PIRA bomb following an unsuccessful evacuation order.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe reason why so many people were caught up in the groups activities was because they routinely sought to inflict financial damage to the capital as a part of their economic warfare campaign. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile they undoubtedly inflicted large financial damages to the pockets of London’s establishments, and even as Rogers’s has pointed out likely damaged the city’s tourist reputation, they failed to achieve their ultimate goal.  The British government ultimately had a much larger pool of wealth to tap into than the PIRA, and at no point did the Troubles become a war they could not financially afford. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe steadfast determination of the citizen’s of London to carry on in the face of financial ruin was further demonstrated by the owners of the Harrods’s department store, who after being attacked by the PIRA in 1983, defiantly reopened their store only three days after it had been defaced. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn a less quantifiable level, the city of London is most likely now better able to deal with acts of aggression in the present, as a result of the IRA’s relentless campaign. In a way, initiatives such as the ‘ring of steel’ - a system of checkpoints constructed around the city designed to monitor incoming vehicles and check for PIRA bombs - can be viewed as a precursor to similar measures used to prevent attacks in the 21st century, and demonstrates how the city has learnt from the past. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/p-check.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">Members of the Royal Regiment of Wales perform a Personal Check (P Check) in 1979.

As has been mentioned, the IRA considered itself to be an army, it is therefore significant that there was no military surrender or capitulation on their part. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Good Friday Agreement, signed in 1998, was a major landmark political achievement that has shaped the relationship between the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ever since, with continued peace and harmony between all parties involved being the most welcome consequence.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, the IRA continued to function - in numerous forms - as an organisation all the way up to 2005, with many of its former members likely still being alive and informally active in their communities to this day as a result. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/good-friday-agreement.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        The front cover of the Good Friday Agreement, signed by the participants.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Whytes.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhile the Good Friday Agreement had demanded the complete disarmament of all paramilitary groups it would take the IRA nearly a decade to comply and formally end its campaign in the mid-2000s. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe legacy of the Irish Republican Army’s decades long assault on the British capital has mostly been put to the back of the British public’s conscious since then. In a way this is perfectly understandable, new threats that are often more complicated to understand have risen up to replace them.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, as Britain is currently in the complicated and ugly process of rediscovering its place in Europe the topic of Northern Ireland and Ireland will undoubtedly continue to crop up. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAgainst this current backdrop it is therefore more important than ever to keep in mind the events of the Troubles of the past, so as to ensure the same bloodshed is not witnessed again in Ireland and the United Kingdom.\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Further Reading:</h3>\r\n\r\nIf you only have a limited amount of time to delve into the complicated topic of the Troubles, I would highly recommend you check-out <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bandit-Country-IRA-South-Armagh/dp/0340717378\" target=\"_blank\">Toby Harnden’s Bandit Country </a>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe book is a thoroughly engrossing gateway into the topic and offers a perfect window into the world of the IRA and is an essential read for those interested in the subject. \r\n', 'The Troubles - The IRA\'s London Bombing Campaign', '2019-03-01 3:54 pm', 'the-troubles-new.jpg', 'topics', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, NULL, 2);

Born in Germany in 1819 to Ernest Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, Prince Albert is perhaps most famed for his marriage to his cousin, Queen Victoria who he married in 1840. Victoria devoted her life to her beloved Albert, and together they ruled over Britain until 1873 until his untimely death. Throughout his life in England, Albert was a noted patron of the arts and was responsible for the Great Exhibition of 1851. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis portrait is a replica which was commissioned for the Gallery by Queen Victoria herself, and is based on a portrait which was painted of the Prince in 1859. Trustees were initially anxious to represent Albert in the collection however, after discreet enquires the portrait was hung and presented to the Gallery by Victoria in 1867 – How could you say no to a Queen? \r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFun Fact- 2019 marks 200 years since the Birth of Prince Albert, so how could we not include this stunning portrait in our must-see portraits at the Gallery?\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>2. William Shakespeare (1564-1616)</h3> \r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/national-portrait-gallery-image4-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        William Shakespeare\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: NPG, London.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn in 1564 in Stratford-Upon-Avon, William Shakespeare is the most celebrated English poet and playwright in history. Shakespeare spent most of his working life in London, both and an actor and a playwright, his works were immensely popular in public theatres and the court. In 1599 Shakespeare (along with four other men) bought a single share for the famous Globe Theatre, which is now called ‘Shakespeare’s Globe’ in homage to the playwright. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Globe is located in Southwark (although it is a reconstruction) and visitors can tour the iconic theatre and learn more about Shakespeare’s history and ties to the theatre and the City. This painting is an important one, as it is the image, we primarily see being associated with Shakespeare however, this image is not a definite portrait of him.  \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot much is known about the portrait however, many believe it may have been painted by John Taylor and that it has good claim to be a life portrait of Shakespeare. The portrait is known as ‘Chandos Portrait’, after a previous owner, and it was the first ever portrait which was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in 1856. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Dame Christabel Pankhurst (1880-1958)</h3> \r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/national-portrait-gallery-image5-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        A portrait of Christabel Pankhurst, by Ethel Wright.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: NPG, London.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the centenary of the Woman’s Suffrage Movement in 2018, this striking portrait of Christabel Pankhurst is a must see for visitors of the Gallery. After studying law at Manchester University, Christabel joined the Womens Social and Political Union (WSPU) which was established by her mother Emmeline Pankhurst in 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe WSPU’s main aim was to campaign for Women’s right to vote, and as Christabel was a charismatic and persuasive speaker, she was in charge of organising rallies, processions and campaigns of civil disobedience such as bombing and arson attacks. Her contribution was recognised in 1936, when she was made a Dame in honour of her dedication to female emancipation. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThis portrait was first shown at the Womens Exhibition which was organised by the WSPU in 1909- Note the integration of the Suffragette tricolour, which represented loyalty and dignity, purity and hope, which all WSPU members were encouraged to strive for and integrate themselves into their every-day lives. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Food and Drink facilities:</h3> \r\nYes, there are food at drink facilities at the Gallery. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\nPortrait Restaurant offers breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea or dinner, with incredible views of Trafalgar Square down to the Houses of Parliament. \r\nPortrait Café serves light snack food such as sandwiches, salads, soups, cakes and coffee. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/national-portrait-gallery-image6-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       Inside the National Portrait Gallery.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: NPG, London.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Friday Lates Bar opens every Friday from 6pm-8:30 and offers beers, prosecco, wine or gins.  \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Tours:</h3> \r\nYes, Tours are available at the National Portrait Gallery. \r\nYou can customise and plan your own tour based on Time Period, Theme or Recent Acquisitions online on the Gallery website (please see the link below) \r\n \r\n<a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/explore/tours \" target=\"_blank\"> The National Portrait Gallery / Tours </a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Nearest station/Tube:</h3> \r\nThe nearest tube stations are Charing Cross (approx. a 3-5-minute walk) and Leicester Square (approx. a 5-6-minute walk). \r\n\r\n<h3>Bus routes:</h3> \r\nRoutes 3, 6, 9, 11, 13, 15, 23, 24, 87, 91, 139, and 176 stops at Trafalgar Square.\r\n\r\n<h3>Postcode/address:</h3> \r\nNational Portrait Gallery St Martin’s Place, London, WC2H 0HE.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Accessibility:</h3> \r\nConcessionary rates apply to young people aged 12-18, disabled visitors, senior citizens, ES40 cardholders and students in full-time education.

(42, 'Brighton Palace Pier, opened on 20 May 1899, was built as a pleasure pier to entertain and delight the high number of visitors brought by Britain’s growing railway \r\n\r\nnetwork. Designed by Richard Saint George Moore on behalf of the Brighton Marine and Palace Pier Company, it was the third pier to be built in Brighton; alongside the \r\n\r\nOld Chain Pier and the West Pier. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe latter of these was also a pleasure pier, making Brighton the ultimate sea-side resort.\r\nIn 1891 construction of the Palace Pier began, but was slow due to financial problems. During a storm in 1896 the Old Chain Pier was destroyed, its debris causing much \r\n\r\ndamage to the new pier and delaying construction further. \r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Public-Advertisement-Palace-Pier.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Advertisement for Palace Pier amusements, 3 September 1903\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Brighton Pier\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div> </div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features of the pier.</h4>\r\nThe Palace Pier cost an astonishing £137,000 to build and was 1500 feet long (457.2 metres). In its early years it featured illuminated archways, as well as rooms for \r\n\r\nreading, dining, and smoking. There was a landing place for steam boats and a section for bathers, free between 7am and midday (Brighton Gazette - 3 September 1903). \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA 1500 seat theatre opened at the seaward end of the pier in April 1901, and after it was refurbished in 1911 it hosted an array of music hall stars. A pleasure garden \r\n\r\nwas added in the centre of the pier in 1910. \r\n  \r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Brigton-Palace-Pier.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Illustration of the \r\n\r\nBrighton Palace Pier shortly before it opened, 11 January 1899 (The Sketch)\r\n        <span>	Source: Brighton Pier\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div> </div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/Brigton-Palace-Pier-1.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Illustration of the \r\n\r\nBrighton Palace Pier in 1901\r\n        <span>	Source: James Gray Collection / The Regency Society\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div> </div>\r\n\r\n<h4>The twentieth century and beyond</h4>\r\nThe pier continued to develop its entertainment functions; the 1930s saw the introduction of dodgems and a big wheel. During World War Two the pier was closed and \r\n\r\nguarded by soldiers to prevent its use as a landing point by enemy troops. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the War the Palace Pier continued to attract visitors, becoming ever more prominent as its popular neighbour, the West Pier, began to fall into disrepair \r\n\r\nfollowing a change in ownership in the 1960s. New arcade games like Space Invaders were introduced in the 1980s, propelling the pier into the modern age. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday the pier is 1733 feet long (525 metres) and still privately owned; it features video arcades, slot machines, sea-side stalls and a fairground and is an iconic \r\n\r\npart of the sea-front.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h4>Visitor information:</h4>\r\nThe pier is open every day, except for Christmas day.

Two years later and with the outbreak of the First World War he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the First World War he was injured twice, initially in Gallipoli and then for a second time in Palestine.

(46, 'The Clifton Suspension Bridge was designed by the prolific Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel and first opened to the public over 150 years ago, after a long period of construction.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nIn 1829 a competition was opened to design a bridge to cross the river Avon and gorge, funded by the Society of Merchant Venturers from an initial bequest from William Vick, a Bristol wine merchant in the year 1753. The first round of entries saw all the designs rejected, including that from a 23 year old Brunel.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nOne year later the competition re-opened and Brunel’s design won. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h4>Construction of the bridge</h4>\r\nWork on the bridge began in 1831, but it was hindered by cold weather, riots and financial issues; at one point the project was abandoned completely before restarting and The Times reported that Bristolians must have felt its completion was “an unattainable ideal- a sort of phantom project that haunted the shores of the Avon…” These issues meant that when Brunel died in 1859 he never saw the bridge completed.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWilliam Henry Barlow and John Hawkshaw took over the venture upon Brunel’s death and the bridge was finally opened to a jubilant crowd of 150,000 people on 8 December 1864.

(47, 'The Anglo Saxon Royal Cemetery at Sutton Hoo is a unique 6th to 7th century burial ground of high status individuals. Around twenty earthen burial mounds make up the cemetery and, while they may seem unremarkable from the surface, archaeologists have discovered far more beneath the surface. These mounds were designed to be seen and to make a statement about the status of the individuals interred beneath them. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many of the mounds were damaged as a result of being robbed during the Tudor period – something which is woefully common for visible burial mounds as they would often be looted in pursuit of ‘treasure’. Since then, however, numerous investigations have taken place surrounding the mounds. The first proper excavation was conducted in 1939 by self-taught archaeologist Basil Brown, commissioned and organised by the landowner, Edith Pretty. It was this first dig that uncovered the great ship burial of Mound One and made Sutton Hoo a centre of archaeological exploration ever since. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image1.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Helmet from the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, England. 7th century AD.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: British Museum // Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Burial Mounds</h3>\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the mounds is Mound One, where an immense 90ft ship burial was first unearthed in 1939. There are actually two ship burials at Sutton Hoo - the lesser known being under Mound Two. Unfortunately, this burial was disturbed by looters, but iron ship rivets reveal the presence of a small boat under the mound. This style of burial reflected contemporary practices in 7th century Sweden, showing a connection between Anglo Saxons in (what is now known as) East Anglia and cultures elsewhere in northern Europe. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe funerals would’ve been “performative” with lavish grave goods, ceremony and the construction of the immense mounds would have been made by hand. Not only was the burial packed with an abundance of rich grave goods, but the committal of an entire ship to the ground would have been an amazing spectacle. It would have cemented in their memory the royal status and significance of the individual buried. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image2.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Burial mound at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, UK. This mound has been reconstructed to its supposed original height.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot be sure exactly who was buried, it is generally accepted that this is the likely resting place of Rædwald, ruler of the East Angles and the first king to rule as overlord over England as a whole. According to Bede’s Historia Ecclesiastica, Rædwald was amongst the earliest Anglo Saxon rulers in England to be baptised and he is credited with playing a significant role in the establishment of Christianity within the ruling classes. His new faith, however, earned the disapproval of his household and queen, who tried to coax him back to his pagan Gods (Plunkett 2005). \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nRædwald maintained elements of his pagan lifestyle and allowed the East Angles to worship both the Christian and the traditional Anglo-Saxon religions if they desired, something the devout Bede criticised him for. As a result of the immense wealth, status and religious associations of the individual under Mound One, it’s clear to see why Rædwald is such a strong candidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Artefacts in focus</h3> \r\n\r\nFortunately, not all the mounds were looted and this meant that, upon excavation, archaeologists uncovered a trove of rich grave goods in their original position. These grave goods (objects placed in a grave alongside a body) can be used to give us an insight into the wealth of the individual. For example, the grave is full of military equipment and valuable weapons, indicating their role as a warrior king within Anglo Saxon society. Similar equipment is found underneath Mound Seventeen, where a young warrior is poignantly buried alongside their horse and an abundance of weapons – their horse would have been sacrificed for the funeral which would have been a spectacular albeit grisly ritual display.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nChristian faith is also demonstrated in several of the items that accompanied the individual to the grave. These objects are amongst the main reasons that the grave is thought to belong to Rædwald. As religious beliefs can play such a huge part in people’s understanding of death and the afterlife, objects with religious motifs and associations are common finds, especially at times of religious transition such as Anglo Saxon period. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image4.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Burial chamber of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, England. Reconstruction shown in the Sutton Hoo Exhibition Hall.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, ten nested silver bowls from the Eastern Empire were found alongside two Byzantium silver spoons with the names of the Apostles ‘Paul’ and ‘Saul’ engraved on them, in Greek. These are suggested to be possible baptismal gifts, buried as a symbol of Rædwald’s conversion to Christianity. There are also symbols of crosses on brooches, and a secret chamber hidden in the back of the gold Great Buckle that may have housed a Christian relic. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe Great Buckle is an incredible example of master goldsmithing, with interwoven ribbon animal decoration and fine detailing. Perhaps the most exquisite artefacts found in the grave are a pair of fine filigree worked shoulder clasps, inlayed with garnets, millefiori designs, interlacing ribbon animal decoration and filigree surrounds. The motifs on the buckle are packed full of Anglo Saxon symbolism, cementing Rædwald’s cultural identity.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe Sutton Hoo helmet is perhaps the most recognisable artefact from the grave. As well as its striking appearance and precious materials, it is laden with symbolism. It has been argued that the helmet makes reference to one-eyed Odin from Norse Mythology (Price and Mortimer 2014), due to imagery represented across northern Europe. If you look closely, you will notice a deliberate absence of gold foils over the left eye of the helmet and over the left eye of an animal head near the crow. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image5.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Sutton Hoo helmet reconstructed.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the low light of a feasting hall, this would result in the illumination of the right eye, and the casting of a shadow over the left – a powerful allusion to Odin and possibly declaring the wearer to be of the same status as the pagan god.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe placement of drinking horns (a common Anglo Saxon grave good) in the grave may have also served to create an image of the “worthy dead” (Pollington 2011: 21) as the possession and use of feasting equipment marked an individual’s place within society. The feasting equipment and lyre paint an image of a mead hall, full of music and celebration, with Rædwald as the gracious host. The funeral itself may have included some mead-fuelled celebration of the life of the deceased. Evidence of funerary feasting at the grave-side is common at Anglo Saxon burial sites (Lee 2007), and it may have been part of a transitionary ritual to aid passing into the afterlife.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>‘Ghosts’ in the sand</h3> \r\n\r\n\r\nTaphonomy’ is the study of the preservation, decay or changes to archaeological material after it has been deposited in the ground. A detailed, forensic approach to excavation and study of excavated material allows archaeologists to reconstruct the story of what has happened to organic material before, during and after burial. Soil conditions, burrowing animals, climate and even gnawing dogs can have a huge impact on survival of organic material.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAt Sutton Hoo, the acidic soil conditions meant that the great oak ship did not survive its 1400 years in the soil and the bones of Rædwald had long-since decayed. How, then, did archaeologists claim to ‘find’ the great ship burial and burials? \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image6.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Sand Bodies of Sutton Hoo.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: P.M.Sabin Moore Blog\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Ghosts’ of the organic materials appeared as staining in the acidic yellow sand - archaeologists have to have a keen eye for changes in soil colour and texture, so they were able to spot these anomalies and excavate around them, creating ‘sand people’ (similar in appearance to some of the Pompeii casts) or identifying the structure of the ship. These were inhumation burials, but cremation burials were also uncovered at Sutton Hoo. Cremations are likely to have been the earliest at the site (Carver 1998) and are found under several mounds, as well as in the surrounding area. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAs well as visible staining, decaying organic material can leave invisible traces of phosphates in the soil. In 1967, soil analysis from Mound One revealed a significant spike in the phosphate levels, indicating that there had once been a body in the grave but it had dissolved in the acidic environment.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Visiting Sutton Hoo</h3> \r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image7.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Sutton Hoo Exhibition Hall with Helmet sculpture\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the artefacts from across the Sutton Hoo site can be seen in the British Museum, but replicas and original are also housed in the Sutton Hoo visitor centre. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to a development project currently being undertaken at the National Trust site, the visitor centre and cemetery reopen to the public from late spring to early summer of 2019.

Although the abbey may lie in ruins, this effigy tomb can still be seen in the north wall of the choir.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nAffreca was the daughter of the King of Man and wife of John de Courcy, the latter of whom was a key figure in the Anglo-Norman invasion of East Ulster.

Once completed, it was the first fully gothic style building in Ulster and it is great architectural importance. \r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe Cistercian monks who colonised the abbey maintained close ties with the Cumberland church throughout the years, with abbots from Grey Abbey becoming abbots at Holmcultram in 1222 and 1237. However, the abbey’s history is otherwise quite sparse. We do, however, know that it was destroyed and damaged many times. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nFirstly, it was almost entirely destroyed at the hands of Edward Bruce’s forces during his invasion (1315-1318). During the Elizabethan era, the monastery was destroyed during military operations and, in 1572, the site was burnt by Brian O’Neill to prevent it acting as refuge for English colonists.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n \r\n\r\nBy the late medieval period, Grey Abbey had fallen into decline and, along with hundreds of other monasteries and parishes, it fell to Henry VIII’s Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1541. The Abbey lay in relative ruin until it (and its surrounding estate) was granted to the Montgomery family in 1607. \r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/grey-abbey-image3-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n     The Dissolution of the monasteries was an event that happened from 1536 to 1540, when English King Henry VIII took away the land and money that the nuns and monks of the Roman Catholic church owned. ...

As a result of the Montgomery family’s custodianship, there are several memorial plaques in their name throughout the nave.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe Abbey is now in the care of the Northern Ireland Environment Agency as a scheduled monument, meaning it is afforded protection under the state. The Friends of the Abbey group also run guided tours of the Abbey and look after the Physic Garden and Visitors’ Centre.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Things to look out for</h3>\r\n\r\nThe Physic Garden is located at the entrance to the Abbey, by the Visitors’ Centre. It was designed to reflect the medicinal gardens usually found in medieval abbeys and monasteries. In the past, herbs and plants would’ve been cultivated in these kinds of gardens to produce medicines and dyes, with many Cistercian monks becoming skilled botanists. \r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/grey-abbey-image4-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n     The Physic Garden is located at the entrance to the Abbey, by the Visitors’ Centre.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nTheir herbal remedies were used to treat a whole host of common ailments, with knowledge of herbalism deriving from Greek, Egyptian, Roman and Arabic texts as well as their own trial-and-error. Many modern medicines derive from plant sources, such as the use of Yew trees to produce chemotherapy drugs or poppies for the production of morphine. \r\n\r\n<br /><br /> \r\n\r\nIf you’re visiting in the summer, during an especially dry period, you might be able to see parch marks in the grass around the cloister. These follow the original walls and mark features of the abbey that no longer survive above the surface. Sub-surface features can affect the growth of grass and other plants, by affecting the amount of moisture in the soil – this shows up as ‘crop marks’ or ‘parch marks’. \r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nMarks like these often help archaeologists identify new sites – during the especially dry summer of 2018, hundreds of new features were identified in the landscape across the UK and Ireland.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe gothic architecture of the Abbey is breath-taking, with dramatic arches, doorways and windows surviving amongst the ruins. Not only is it visually superb, but it is also architecturally significant, as Grey Abbey was the first fully gothic style building in the whole of Ulster. \r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/grey-abbey-image5-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n     The gate to the grounds is open from 8:30am – 8pm. \r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom its completion in 1230, the structure remained virtually unchanged until alterations in the 15th century saw its tower and chancel raised in height. \r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the nave are several impressive buttresses. However, upon closer inspection of the stonework, it becomes clear that these are modern additions. In the early 20th century, the nave faced collapse and in order to stabilise it, the Ministry of Public works carried out conservation work and constructed these buttresses. \r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nDuring conservation or reconstruction of a site through modern additions, it is common practice to set them apart by using different coloured stone, mortar or different masonry patterns. This can also be seen throughout the Abbey in reconstructed and repaired walls.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<h3>Visitor Information</h3>\r\n\r\nAdmission is free, although donations are encouraged to fund the upkeep of the grounds. There is a small Visitors’ Centre at the entrance, with an abundance of displays and activities – there’s even the chance to dress up as a Cistercian monk. \r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nIf you are driving to the site, there is a free-to-use car park and the area is well sign-posted.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nIn terms of accessibility, there is pedestrian and wheelchair access from the car park to the Visitors’ Centre and Physic Garden, but gravel and grass throughout the rest of the site might be difficult for some. \r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe site is open from 8.30am-8pm on weekdays, and 10am-8pm over the weekend. We definitely recommend visiting in the spring or summer to see the grounds in full bloom!\r\n', 'Grey Abbey', '2019-03-01 3:54 pm', 'grey-abbey-header-image-mobile.jpg', 'topics', '54.5358333', '-5.560522', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL);

(59, 'Before the information age, serial killers didn’t make news apart from in the town they were acting. There have been plenty of repeat murderers throughout history dating back to the 2nd century BC and have been mentioned in Greek mythology, but only a select few stick in our heads: Ted Bundy, the Zodiac killer, and Jack the Ripper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image1.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Images of Ted Bundy and the Zodiak Killer.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActive from August to November 1888, Jack the Ripper managed to become one of the most famous serial murderers in history with a victim count of five women in Whitechapel, London. The canonical victims, i.e. those known to have been killed by Jack the Ripper with their death dates are as follows: <mark>Mary Ann “Polly” Nichols (31st August), Annie Chapman (8th September), Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes (30th September), and Mary Jane Kelly (9th November).</mark>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the passing of 130 years, the killer’s identity is still a mystery and was known as the Whitechapel Murderer until Scotland Yard received a letter on the 29th September 1888. The “Dear Boss” letter, written in neat, Roundhand script with red ink, features the writer taunting the police - <mark>“they won’t fix me just yet. … How can they catch me now.” - and finally signed “Yours truly Jack the Ripper”.</mark> The publication of this letter meant that his nickname caught like wildfire and was henceforth used by people from all levels of society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image2-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        The first page of the \"Dear Boss\" letter.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the Illustrated Police News on the 20th October 1888, police were sifting through “upwards of seven hundred letters” all relating to the Jack the Ripper case.  It can be estimated that over 1000 letters were sent by the end of the case. By the end of October, he had murdered four of the canonical five women and police were no closer to finding him. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nMost of these letters, some 300 of which are still kept at the Corporation of London Records Office, were deemed as hoaxes. There is a small handful, however, that is taken seriously by experts and those interested in the cold case: the aforementioned <mark>“Dear Boss” letter</mark>, the <mark>“Saucy Jacky” postcard</mark>, and the <mark>“From Hell” letter</mark> (also known as the Lusk letter as it was directed to George Lusk). \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAll of these were signed “Jack the Ripper” and the content was such that the police paid special attention to them. The Lusk letter from 15th October 1888 in particular was concerning; <mark>a human kidney accompanied it </mark> which was significant as two weeks earlier, Catherine Eddowes was found murdered with her left kidney missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image3.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n        Facsimile of the front of the \"Saucy Jacky\" postcard.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this may seem proof, it has never been ascertained whether or not this was Catherine’s kidney. Earlier this year it was claimed that “Saucy Jacky” and “Dear Boss” were written by the same hand due to linguistic similarities and handwriting consistencies. \r\n\r\n<h3>Letters and Clues </h3>\r\n\r\nIn addition to the letters, even though they may have all been fake, or those deemed as fake may have been authentic (put simply: nobody knows), there was one other piece of potentially worthwhile evidence. In the stairwell of 108-119 Model Dwellings in Goulston Street, a piece of cloth was found by Constable Alfred Long. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThis filthy scrap was part of Catherine Eddowes apron, who was killed mere hours prior, and was stained with blood. Above the apron on the wall or jamb of the building’s entrance was written <mark>“The Juwes are the men that will not be blamed for nothing”.</mark> Transcriptions differ as we have no photographic evidence; the police thought it best to wash the message away to avoid stirring any anti-Semitic tensions given that the area had a large Jewish community. But, like many clues connected with the Jack the Ripper case, we have no way of knowing if this graffiti is actually linked to the murders.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image4-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       Copy of graffito in Goulston Street, attached to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Charles Warren\'s report to the Home Office on the Whitechapel murders.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>The Police</h3>\r\nThoroughly disturbed from the beginning, the police formed the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee. Led by George Lusk (yes, the same man who received a random kidney in the post), groups of volunteers patrolled the East End streets at night in an attempt to catch the elusive killer. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image5-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       George Lusk, President of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn top of this, the Metropolitan Police (most notably the Whitechapel H division), City of London Police, and Scotland Yard were hard at work interviewing countless witnesses and suspects without any real leads. The key witness statements they obtained lacked immense amounts of detail which made it difficult to form a precise picture of what had happened. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nRecently experts have deduced that he must have been a very typical, ordinary person with the ability to blend into the background without arousing any suspicion which only adds to the difficulties the police faced.  Timing was also not in the Metropolitan Police’s favour: they were put under great stress as there were shifts and instability in leadership which damaged officer morale. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the technology and procedures available at the time were not sufficient for this kind of investigation. Fingerprinting, Crime Scene Investigation, crime scene photography, and forensics were all to be discovered several years later - fingerprinting was only implemented as standard procedure in 1901 - without these thorough investigative techniques we use today, it would have been extraordinarily difficult to find the murderer. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image6-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       Use of fine powder and brush to reveal latent fingerprints.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nIf these murders happened now, the Ripper would have been found after the first murder. DNA profiling is a gift to crime scenes, it is the control+F of perpetrator identification.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>Suspects</h3>\r\nAs the police did not have enough evidence to prosecute any suspect, the public let their imaginations run wild and numerous theories, both feasible and a little less believable, were thought up. At the time the police had their suspects, the favoured one being <mark> George Chapman (born Seweryn Kłosowski)</mark> who emigrated to London from Poland just before the murders began. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHe also had a track record of poisoning his wives. Also from Poland was <mark>Aaron Kosminski.</mark> This man spent a great deal of time in an insane asylum but there isn’t really anything to firmly suggest he murdered several women. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image7-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       George Chapman (December 14, 1865 - April 7, 1903) was the English name taken by serial killer Seweryn Antonowicz Kłosowski.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThen we have <mark>‘Leather Apron’, whose real name was John Pizer or Piser,</mark> also of Polish origin. There was absolutely no evidence for him being the murderer apart from the fact that he may have committed minor assaults on prostitutes and in fact, he had alibis for two out of five murders.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most curious suspect was <mark>Francis Tumblety,</mark> he was a quack doctor from the United States with an impressive moustache if the photographs and drawings are anything to go by. He is said to have been a misogynist with a strong loathing for prostitutes in particular and once showed a friend his display of preserved uteri at a dinner party. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image8-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       Photo of Francis Tumblety.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThis along with the American nature we have seen in the alleged authentic letters, plus a knowledge of human anatomy, all points to a likely suspect. The uterine collection, however, has not been proved, nor has the authenticity of the letters. Once again, evidence falls through.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe press and public had their opinions, of course. <mark>Thomas Neill Cream</mark> was a name that cropped up often. He was also a doctor specialising in abortions - bonus point for female anatomical knowledge; and had previously poisoned several women - another point for being able to kill someone; all signs so far point to him being a likely suspect. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nExcept, he was in Illinois between 1881 and 1891 serving time for his crimes, meaning there was no way he could have been in London in 1888 terrorising Whitechapel. There is apparently the possibility, according to some Jack the Ripper enthusiasts, that Cream had a double who killed the five, or more, women in London. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image9-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       Photo of Dr. Thomas Neill Cream.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nDespite the unlikelihood of him being Jack the Ripper, it is alleged that his last words before execution were <mark>“I am Jack…” </mark>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nOther suspects include males who personally knew the victims, such as <mark>George Hutchinson and Joseph Barnett</mark> who both knew Mary Jane Kelly. More outlandish suspects, who were suggested long after the murders but not taken seriously by scholars, include <mark>Lewis Carroll and Walter Sickert.</mark>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image10.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       Walter Sickert; his Persuasion painting.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nThe former because of some anagrams found in his work, and the latter because he was known to have an interest in the Ripper murders and painted Jack the Ripper’s Bedroom and the subject of his Camden Town Murder paintings connect him to the population of the East End.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nArthur Conan Doyle and Inspector Abberline even proposed that it was not Jack the Ripper the police were searching for, but rather <mark>Jill the Ripper</mark> - either that Jack was posing as a woman to avoid detection or that the killer was a midwife or abortionist. This theory was born after the murder of Mary Kelly based on a testimony by Mrs Maxwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous popular suspects is the <mark> Duke of Clarence and Avondale (also known as Prince Albert Victor Christian Edward, or Eddy for short)</mark> and was Queen Victoria’s grandson.  Theories surrounding him differ but can all be nullified by the fact that he was at Balmoral during the murders of Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image11-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       Prince Albert Victor.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nIn 2017, a controversial new theory was put forth: that Jack the Ripper was actually H.H. Holmes, commonly referred to as ‘America’s First Serial Killer’. A series entitled American Ripper, shown on the History channel, explores the determination of Holmes’ great-great-grandson to prove his theory that the two killers were one and the same. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nGranted, there is no record to show that Holmes was in America during the Whitechapel murders, and there is proof he visited London at some point. He also fits the vague descriptions eye witness accounts gave at the time, he had extensive medical knowledge, and went on to kill somewhere between 20 and 200 people from 1891 to 1894, some murders may have been committed during his youth as well. Once again however, the evidence and claims are pure speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image12-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       Born Herman Webster Mudgett, also known as Dr. Henry Howard Holmes or H.

Christer Holmgren, a Swedish journalist, has studied the Jack the Ripper case for over 30 years and noticed what most of us had skimmed over. The documentary based on his theory explains the details and discrepancies that make it exceedingly difficult to dispute.   \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>The Victims</h3>\r\n<mark>Polly Nichols</mark> is usually considered the first victim, the woman before her being Martha Tabram who was found in George Yard Buildings with 39 stab wounds to her torso. Polly was found with her throat cut down to the spine and with a number of wounds to her lower abdomen in Buck’s Row. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<mark>Annie Chapman</mark> was found a little over a week later in a Hanbury Street back garden, also with her throat cut to the bone except the killer had now escalated his violence and mutilated her abdomen. Parts of her abdominal wall, navel, uterus, vagina, and bladder were missing from her body. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image13-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       Newspaper detailing the events surrounding the murders.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<mark>Elizabeth Stride</mark> also had a near-severed head, along with <mark>Catherine Eddowes.</mark> Elizabeth, however, bore no further wounds and this is typically boiled down to the assumption the murderer was interrupted by the approaching footsteps of Louis Diemschutz.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThis then explains Catherine’s murder committed 45 minutes later; her uterus and left kidney was not with the body. It is also with Catherine that we see facial wounds as well. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHowever, the most horrific and stomach-churning of the murders is that of <mark>Mary Jane Kelly.</mark> One almost condemns the use of crime scene photography in this case as it is inconceivable that someone would perform such brutality on another person. Another difference in Mary’s case is that she was killed and mutilated inside her own room as opposed to out on the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br /> \r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image14-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       Mary Jane Kelly - Illustrated Police News\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nExactly why, though, nobody really knows but what we can assume is that the private room gave the Ripper more time to satisfy his bloodlust. She was unrecognisable by the time he had fled. Most of her organs had been removed and placed around her or next to her bed and large quantities of flesh were stripped off, exposing bone in the process. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThis was truly the pinnacle of Jack the Ripper’s merciless reign and it had left its mark on the entirety of the district. What is perhaps most fascinating with his modus operandi is that he consistently strangled these women before cutting their throats and mutilating them which strongly suggests that he did not want to cause them pain. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nSuffocation is one of the most painless ways to die so it could be implied that the murderer felt some kind of sympathy towards the women and he was not completely sadistic. Alternatively, he knew that the blood would splatter if the women were still alive and they would be more likely to scream, leading to his capture.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image15-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n       Streets in White Chapel, where the murders took place.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nWhitechapel was not a desirable location for anyone. It is stereotyped as an over-crowded, impoverished, miserable place, covered by the soot and pollution from nearby coal factories and this stereotype is entirely true. Most inhabitants were poor, there were numerous pubs, sometimes two or more on one street which would feed the alcohol dependencies that many indulged. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHouses were small and it was not rare to have whole families of several members living in one room, perhaps taking in a lodger as they hadn’t enough money to live on.  Crime was rife, but rarely involved murder. Typically there was pickpocketing, assault, drunken offences and general petty crime so when murders began to happen with little space between, it really shook the population.  \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nWhen people noticed it was mainly prostitutes being targeted, this community began to honestly fear for their lives.\r\n\r\n<h3>Serial Killing in the 19th and 20th Centuries</h3>\r\n\r\nEven though Jack the Ripper eclipses most other serial killers, especially those during the same century, there were murderers that acted for a longer period of time or killed more people. At the beginning of the 19th century, Andreas Bichel killed two women between 1806 and 1808 after luring them to his fortune telling scam. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image16-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n      Picture of Andreas Bichel, The Bavarian Ripper.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHe attempted to kill three other women and has been dubbed the Mädchenschlächter, or ‘girl slaughterer’ and in the English speaking world, he is known as the Bavarian Ripper. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAcross the pond in Austin, Texas, the ‘Servant Girl Annihilator’ was guilty of 8 instances of murder and rape from 1884 until Christmas Eve 1885. He did not have the same victim profile that Jack the Ripper had; the three first women he killed were cooks and servants, the fourth was an 11 year old girl, then a heterosexual couple, and finally two women were murdered on Christmas Eve. Class and race seemed to have nothing to do with his attacks. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nThe murders only stopped when the police shot a man beating a woman in February 1886. The man died of his wound the next day. Curiously whilst Whitechapel residents speculated and feared Jack the Ripper, his Mexican counterpart was running amok from 1880-1908. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe Mexican Ripper or El Chalequero, real name Francisco Guerrero Pérez, killed around 20 prostitutes through strangulation and mutilation and left them in the Consulado River. He was known for being a virulent misogynist with a particular hatred for prostitutes.  Strangely enough, during the very same months as Jack the Ripper, body parts were turning up in the River Thames and around East London.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image18.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n     Picture of The Mexican Ripper, El Chalequero.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time, the newspapers thought they were linked however it seems likely that the Thames Torso Murders, which took place between 1887-1889, were from other murderers. In these cases as well, whoever committed these murders was never found nor were there any clues or suspects.  In this sense, the dismemberment murders were even more of a mystery than the Jack the Ripper cases which the authorities and the media seemed to focus on. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nShortly after the London murders, the French Ripper began his spree from 1894 to 1897. Joseph Vacher, after attempting to kill himself twice - one of which left him with a partially paralysed face and a dodgy eye - stabbed, mutilated and raped 11 victims (one woman, five teenage girls and five teenage boys) but blamed his murders on the claim he had been bitten by a rabid dog as a child. After confessing to his crimes, he was executed by guillotine on New Year’s Eve 1898.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image19-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n     Picture of The French Ripper, Joseph Vacher.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crimes of Jack the Ripper grotesquely manifested themselves in later murders throughout the following century, especially in Britain. During World War Two, Gordon Cummins decided to use the Blackout to his grim advantage. He joined the RAF and was participating in a training course in February 1942; he was in London for most of the month however his murderous rampage lasted a mere six days. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nOver barely a week he killed four women and heartlessly mutilated three of them. There seemed to be a sexual emphasis to his murders and had he not left his gas mask or his belt at the scenes of attempted attacks, it is possible he would have gone on to kill more women.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHe was arrested on 16th February 1942 and was eventually executed in June that year. There have been two more Ripper-like serial killers in England since then: “Jack the Stripper” who was active 1964-65 and the Yorkshire Ripper who killed between 1975 and 1980. The former murdered six prostitutes who were found by the River Thames. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image20-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n     Picture of Jack the Stripper.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAll were found stripped of clothing hence the unknown killer’s nickname and the fact that these murders are often referred to as the ‘Nude Murders’. The latter murderer is a man named Peter Sutcliffe, who killed 13 women. Media have the tendency to claim that prostitutes were the victims however out of all his victims, only six were sex workers, meaning he targeted women in general. He received 20 life sentences for his crimes and is currently serving time in HM Prison Frankland, Durham. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>The Sensation of Jack the Ripper</h3>\r\nThe modern murderers bring us to the modern age. Why exactly have we chosen to etch Jack the Ripper into our minds rather than any of the aforementioned murderers? It is in part to good timing and good publicity. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHe killed when transatlantic telegraphy was reliable and used frequently, meaning that the London news could be communicated across to North America as well as to Europe - something earlier criminals couldn’t do - and the local newspapers published letters allegedly from the killer himself. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nEarly on in the case he was given a name which is not only catchy but also adds drama and suspense, which the general public love. On top of this, the elusiveness he has succeeded in maintaining has only increased his infamy over the decades. With the years having turned into almost a century and a half, this relatively small serial killer case has become a worldwide murder mystery and regular people are attempting to achieve some kind of cold case fame through proving who Jack the Ripper was once and for all. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image21-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n     Jack the Ripper (1987 video game).\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether or not it will ever be possible to definitively say who the murderer was, we cannot say. Technological advancements, a sudden discovery of firm evidence, and maybe a time machine could help. There is something fundamentally unique about 19th century England, and especially Victorian London which has been so glorified it has become a fashion and craft movement in itself, known as steampunk. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nBeing a chronological bridge between old and new in terms of technology and progress, the alluring magic of this romanticised era must have something to do with the popularity of Jack the Ripper and Victorian society in general.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image22-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n     Jack the Ripper, Assasin\'s Creed Video Game.\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Assasin\'s Creed Video Game.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Language and Jack the Ripper</h3>	\r\nIt is the nature of human beings to crave answers and the massive question mark that is the identity of this murderer has led to decades of study on the part of armchair detectives. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nBut if we are to continue discussing Jack the Ripper and the women he killed, it is worthwhile to look at the manner in which we speak about them and especially the language writers are choosing to use. The way in which we speak about the victims is of utmost importance. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nUsually they are only referred to as “prostitutes” or sometimes “women” which is admittedly a touch better, yet that is all we hear from them. If we do read about their lives in non-specialised publications, the writing makes it such that they led “a deeply impoverished existence in the slums”, for example.  \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article-img-wrapper\" align=\"center\">\r\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:8888/apps_with_moorexa/hh/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image23-web.jpg\" class=\"img\">\r\n        <div class=\"caption\">\r\n     The Canonical Five\r\n        <span>\r\n			Source: Wikimedia Commons.\r\n		</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThis wording, whilst sounding good from a journalistic point of view, creates a particular setting in the reader’s mind and provides them with prejudices and assumptions that may not have been reality. It can cause the reader to forget about the individuals and prevent sympathising with them.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nNewspaper and magazine articles and documentaries in recent times have overly dramatised the events of Autumn 1888 to the point of farcical theatricality, all for the sake of viewers and readers. It is through this exaggerated interpretation that the media have belittled the women he murdered, linguistically undermining them and reducing them to mere objects in the situation.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThey fade away into the shadow of their killer. Language shapes the way we view the world and subsequently our opinions on it. Immediately identifying these women as ‘prostitutes’ is not only historically inaccurate but it is damaging to their identities as women. It implies that this is what they did as a job regularly and perhaps we don’t realise that unlike some sex workers today, they were more or less forced into it. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe victims tried to make money through other means, such as selling their possessions, cleaning, crocheting, and selling sex was really a last resort to stop them from starving and living on the streets. Furthermore, sex workers are a consistently marginalised part of society and a slew of misinformed myths surround them and their work. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAs Kate Lister succinctly phrases it, the word ‘prostitute’ has always been ‘linked to a state of dishonour’ thanks to its first definition and usage. There has also always been an air of violence and abuse surrounding sex workers which further adds to the perceived justification of the horrors they endured. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThis term ‘sex worker’ may seem like anachronistic political correctness however language needs to evolve as we reflect upon our society. The role of the historian is to look back on history as objectively as possible but how can we do that if we use words loaded with negative implications? \r\n', 'Jack the Ripper', '2019-03-01 3:54 pm', 'jack-the-ripper-header-image-mobile.jpg', 'topics', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL),
(60, 'William Wilberforce (d.1833), abolitionist and social reformer, was born at Wilberforce House in 1759. As the Member of Parliament for Yorkshire, Wilberforce famously campaigned against the slave trade. \r\n<br />\r\n<br /><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nToday’s building, conveniently located next to the quayside and high street, was originally on the site of a merchant’s house built in c.1590 for the Lister family, exporters of lead. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nJohn Lister and his son, also John, both became Mayors of Hull and the latter was knighted. The family was prestigious enough to entertain Charles I, who stayed at the house in 1639. The current structure was built in 1656. From 1709, John Thornton, a merchant of lead and cloth, owned the house. The merchant’s apprentice, William Wilberforce, the grandfather to the abolitionist, married Thornton’s daughter, and the house passed onto the Wilberforce family in 1732. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nMerchants of Hull tended to carry out their trade with the Baltic states and Europe, differing from Bristol and Liverpool who had a large stake in the slave trade.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>The abolitionist</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nWilberforce was educated at Cambridge, where he met the future Prime Minister William Pitt and entered political life. He was a talented orator and represented the abolitionist cause in Parliament, introducing Bills and campaigning for twenty years.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHis influence aided the passing of the Foreign Slave Trade Abolition Bill in 1807, which prohibited the slave trade in the British Empire. Slavery itself was, however, still able to continue. Wilberforce continued campaigning for the abolition of slavery until he retired from politics in 1825. He died on 29 July 1833, just three days after the act to emancipate all slaves in the British colonies passed through the House of Commons.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/wilberforce-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Wilberforce\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>William Wilberforce by the artist Anton Hickel. <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>The House as Museum</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nWilberforce House was opened as Britain\'s first slavery museum in 1906, after it was acquired by the local authority.

(61, 'The first passenger funicular railway in Britain was opened in the seaside town of Scarborough in 1875 by the Scarborough South Cliff Tramway Company, linking The Spa and seafront promenade to the South Cliff. It would be the first of five cliff railways for the popular resort. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDesigned by William Lucas and built by the Crossley Brothers of Manchester, the original system was powered by seawater pumped by two Crossley gas engines and operated by a brakeman in the top station; the system was later replaced by steam engines in 1879 and then electric in the 1940s. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/lift-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Scarborough\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>View of the cliff lift from below.<i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>The cultural origins of the cliff lift</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nSpa waters were discovered in the cliffs in the 1620s by Mrs Thomasin Farrer, a member of the gentry, who noticed the water stained the stones russet-brown. Scarborough soon became fashionable amongst the upper classes for the waters perceived curative effect. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy the end of the century Scarborough was a popular seaside resort: in 1700 a local businessman, Dicky Dickenson, opened the first ‘spaw’. Lodging houses and hotels were formed in Georgian times and a popular music hall and saloon were added in the Victorian period. There were, however, problems with accessibility for an increasing number of visitors due to the seafront being next to the cliffs. In the 1820s a bridge had been built to connect the resort to the town centre. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTowards the end of the century, technological improvements in railways meant that funiculars could be utilised to help visitors navigate the resort. 1400 passengers were carried on the first day of business on 6th July 1875, allowing them to avoid walking the steep 224 steps to the top, for just 1d. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nA visitor to the resort commented on its effectiveness at the end of a day by the seafront, “The anthem played by the band was the signal to go, and moving southward, much as we felt inclined to linger, reached the Cliff tramway, and were in the space of minute placed safely and without fatigue on the top of the cliff” (The Dundee Evening Telegraph - 24 June 1881).

(62, 'The impressive remains of Ravenglass Roman bath house are the tallest and most substantial to be found in northern Britain. Built around 130 AD, the bath house served the nearby fort and civilian settlement (vicus) at Ravenglass.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe fort’s location at Ravenglass harbour gave the site strategic importance, as such it was used as an operating base for the British arm of the Classis Britannica (Roman navy). Its role as a naval base continued throughout the Roman occupation, despite numerous incidents involving local tribes which resulted in the fort being either attacked or burnt down.\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/ravenglass-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Ravenglass\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Ravenglass Bathhouse <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the continued presence of the Roman military allowed a large vicus to develop north of the fort, which thus required the existence of a sizeable bath house to accommodate the burgeoning local population.\r\n\r\n<br><br> \r\n\r\nAs with all bath houses of the period, the baths at Ravenglass would have represented an important symbolic custom and daily ritual in the lives of the local area’s Romanised inhabitants. Interestingly, bath houses were of less importance in Roman Britain, however evidence suggests they were still an intrinsic part of life for those living within or nearby forts. \r\n\r\n<br><br> \r\n\r\nArchitecturally, Roman bath houses were some of Iron Age Britain’s most sophisticated buildings, with each bathhouse containing the requisite changing room (apodyterium), warm room (tepidarium), hot room (caldarium), cold room (frigidarium) and open exercise yard (palaestra). Excavations at Ravenglass indicate the presence of such rooms, with two rooms including under-floor hypocaust (heating systems) uncovered at the site.\r\n\r\n<br><br> \r\n\r\nThe site is in the care of English Heritage and is open every day – entrance is free. There is charged public car parking in the town of Ravenglass from which the bath house is conveniently signposted.

(63, 'Visitors to the village of Piercebridge will find not one, but two Roman sites to enjoy - a Roman bridge and a Roman fort. \r\nThe first bridge to be built at Piercebridge was constructed to cross the River Tees at the point where the Roman road, Dere Street met the river. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBuilt during the 1st Century AD, the location became particularly popular with merchants who wished to benefit from the trade links offered by both the river and road. Around 150 AD the wooden bridge was destroyed by flooding, thus the Roman army built a new, predominantly stone bridge further downstream, the remains of which are what can be seen today. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/piercebridge-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Piercebridge\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Bridge <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nLater, during the 3rd century AD, a large fort was built to the south of the bridge to house auxiliary cavalry. Believed to be called Morbium by the Romans, the fort conformed to the traditional ‘playing card’ layout with a headquarters in the centre surrounded by the requisite barracks, workshops, granaries and hospital. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAll Roman forts were built to adhere to specifications outlined by specially trained surveyors and architects. Whilst no British forts can be attributed to any one surveyor or architect, unique evidence uncovered at Piercebridge has identified Attonius Quintianus as a military surveyor working in Britain’s northern territories at this time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nFollowing the withdrawal of Rome’s forces during the 5th century AD, the fort and bridge were initially used by the local populace. However, the bridge later became disused following the river’s change of course, whilst the fort’s use subsequently dwindled and in later years the current village of Piercebridge developed directly above what remained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/piercebridge-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Piercebridge\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Fort <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhilst much of the site is covered by the existing village, interesting remains are still visible, of note are the foundations of the vicus’ bathhouse and the fort’s drainage system. Furthermore, aspects of the fort’s defensive structures can be seen, such as the remains of the ‘V’ shaped ditch that circled the fort to ensure optimum use of the Roman javelin that was thrown from the walls during an attack. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nBoth the bridge (English Heritage) and fort (Darlington Borough Council) are open every day - entrance to each site is free. Free parking for both sites is available in the car park of the nearby George Hotel. Whilst neither site has its own refreshment facilities, Piercebridge has a selection of cafes and pubs, along with a village green perfect for picnics. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>Secondary sources</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nDe la Bedoyere, G.

(64, 'Following the Roman occupation of Britain, an increasing number of rural homes were built across the province. Named ‘villas’ these complexes were in theory the Roman equivalent of farms, however a secondary, perhaps more accurate, definition would be that they were rural dwellings of some pretension, which sometimes had agricultural associations. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBuilt during the mid-1st century AD, Piddington Roman villa is an example of a ‘winged-corridor’ villa, a type of villa that became prolific during the period. ‘Winged-corridor’ villas were formed when nearby buildings were gradually linked to a main villa using a covered corridor to extend the dwelling. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs agricultural dwellings, villas were more than lavish homes, they were also businesses, often requiring the successful production and sale of goods to support those that lived in them – in one complex alone this could include the villa’s owner and his family, servants, overseers and labourers. Remains from Piddington’s final phase of occupation support this view, with evidence of industrial use represented in the finding of iron slag which suggests the presence of an iron working site with furnaces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/paddington-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Darlington\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Piddington Roman Villa <i>Source: Wikimedia </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nPiddington remained occupied throughout the Roman occupation, however quickly fell into disrepair as Rome’s forces were withdrawn in 5th century AD. Evidence of subsequent use during the Anglo-Saxon period has been identified, however this is currently limited to a small dwelling and three burials. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSince the 1970s the site had undergone successive periods of excavation, with each area backfilled once digging has been completed.

(65, 'Mary Anning (1799 –1847) was a prolific fossil collector who made important contributions to the new field of paleontology, influencing ideas about geology and prehistoric life. She collected fossils in the cliffs near her home in Lyme Regis, Dorset, from a young age. Anning’s father was a cabinet maker and supplemented his income by selling fossils or ‘curiosities’. Her family were poor, and after her father died in 1810, they continued to sell fossils to tourists and collectors. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/mary-anning-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Anning\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>A blue plaque at the Lyme Regis Museum, the site of Anning\'s home and her fossil shop. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3>Anning’s discoveries</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nOver the course of her life she discovered significant fossils, including the first complete Ichthyosaur skeleton (with her brother, when she was only twelve); the first complete Plesiosaurus in 1823; and the first Pterodactylus found outside Germany in 1828; all of which are now in the Natural History Museum, London. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer findings also provided evidence that a certain type of fossil, considered to be a bezoar stone, was in fact, fossil faeces.

Unbeknown to the police at the time, the vehicle contained 3.2 tonnes worth of IRA explosives intended to create destruction on a large scale. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nNot wanting to see their plans scuppered the IRA volunteers attempted to flee the scene, forcing Constable PC Raymond Hall – a former Royal Engineer soldier and Falklands War veteran – to give chase.

(69, 'Darlington Railway Museum, Darlington\r\nThe world’s first steam locomotive public railway was The Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR), first opened on 27 September 1825. The North-East was a coal-mining area and from the early 1600s wagonways, made from wood and powered by horse-power, were used to convey coal along the Tyne. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nIn the early 1820s steam power began to be utilised for transportation between inland collieries and the ports. The use of locomotives for the S&DR railway was first proposed in 1821 to connect the mines in Darlington and Stockton, but there were numerous objections due to concerns about noise and smoke. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nHowever, George Stephenson, known to history as the ‘Father of the Railways’, persuaded the shareholders to order a steam-powered locomotive, and the imaginatively named Locomotion No.1 became the first engine built for the line. On the railway’s opening day the engine was driven by Stephenson himself, carrying coal and 450 passengers from Darlington to Stockton, getting up to 15 miles per hour in front of great crowds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/darlington-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Darlington\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Crowds watching the train cross Skerne Bridge in Darlington at the opening of the S&DR, watercolour by John Dobbin (1880s). <i>Source: Tomlinson, The North Eastern Railway, p. 112. </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Expansion and success</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nPublic demand for the service ensured the viability of the railway; just under eighteen months after its opening there were seven coaches running between Stockton and Darlington. Horse-drawn coaches were still used on the route until the 1850s as early locomotives were slow and unreliable, but as steam technology developed horse-power was gradually replaced. The line soon expanded, reaching Middlesbrough and Redcar in 1846.

(70, 'Bremetennacum Veteranorum, more commonly known as Ribchester Roman Fort, was originally established as an auxiliary fort around 72 AD, during the reign of Emperor Vespasian. Situated on the banks of the River Ribble, the fort’s strategic importance is evident in its chosen location beside a crossing over the river at a point where the roads from Eboracum (York), Deva Victrix (Chester) and Luguvalio (Carlisle) converged. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhilst initially built by the XXth legion using timber, the fort underwent a period of development during the late 1st century AD which saw the timber structure replaced with stone, indicating the presence of a more permanent settlement by this time. The fort was home to roughly 500 cavalry troops who were tasked with keeping the local population, the Brigantes tribe, under control.\r\nThe Latin name for Ribchester has the suffix Veteranorum, which suggests Roman army veterans also settled here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/bremetennacum-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Bremetennacum\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Roman ruins in Ribchester <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen retired from service, the veterans of Ribchester appear to have been granted use of the nearby marshland, in which they cut a series of drainage channels to allow the land to be used to grow crops and to raise cattle and horses. The decision to retire at this location, along with the presence of the strategically important road network, allowed Ribchester’s vicus (civilian settlement) to prosper until its eventual abandonment in the 4th century. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs with many forts of the period, Ribchester was endowed with a large bath house which was utilised by both the fort and vicus’ inhabitants. Erected in the 2nd century, the bath house consisted of a furnace room, a caldarium (hot room), a tepidarium (warm room), sudatorium (sweating room), a frigidarium (cold room) and an apodyterium (changing room). \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe excavated foundations of the bath house can be found behind the White Bull Inn, which is also home to four Roman Doric or Tuscan columns, two of which are believed to have come from the remains of the bath house. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>Visitor\'s information</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nVisitors to Ribchester can visit the bath house and the remains of the fort’s granary, both of which are free to enter and open all year round. Also available to visit in Ribchester, is the Roman Museum (open year-round, Adult £4, Child £2.50) which is home to many of the artefacts discovered during the site’s various excavations. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nParking is available at Ribchester’s pay-and-display carpark (around ¼ mile from the museum) and a variety of refreshment outlets can be found in the village.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Templeborough_Roman_Fort_visualised_3D_flythrough_-_Rotherham_(hi-res).webm?embedplayer=yes\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>Secondary sources</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nDe la Bedoyere, G.

(71, 'Bleak House is a four-storey Grade II listed building locating on the cliff overlooking Viking Bay in Broadstairs, Kent. Originally known as Fort House, it was built in 1801 as a residence for a captain of the nearby coastal forts. Charles Dickens spent his summer holidays in Broadstairs, a popular sea-side town from the early nineteenth century, leasing the house between 1837 and 1859. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrote a number of his famous novels whilst residing in the building, including Nicholas Nickleby and David Copperfield; it’s also said to have been his inspiration for Bleak House, which was published in 1853. Charles Dickens study looked over the English Channel at a time when it was a busy thoroughfare for the nearby naval fleet in Chatham and passing trade ships. In the early twentieth century the house became known as Bleak House due to its Dickens connections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/bleak-house-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Bleak House\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Bleak House in the 1920s. <i>Source: Public Domain.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<h3>Twentieth century and today</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe house has been extended and renovated over the years.

(72, 'Binchester Roman Fort, named Vinovia by the Romans, is located just over 1 mile outside of the town of Bishop Auckland. The fort is the largest in County Durham and dates from the 1st century AD, a time when Roman occupation was still a relatively new concept for Iron Age Britain. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDuring this phase of expansion, Rome endeavoured to extend control over its new British territories by building forts, such as Binchester, and establishing a Roman presence in the North East. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/binchester-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Binchester\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 1 - Binchester Roman Fort <i>Source:durham.gov.uk/binchester </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe site for this important fort was chosen due to its proximity to the River Wear, whilst also being adjacent to Dere Street, a vital supply and communications route. Binchester’s location ensured the fort’s longevity, with a Roman presence there until as late as the early 5th Century AD. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nBinchester was a sizeable fort and excavations have indicated that whilst initially built using wood, it was later rebuilt in stone and brick once the Romans felt secure in their surroundings. Excavations have also uncovered the remains of defensive structures, such as earthwork banks and a ballista (heavy missile launcher) platform, which suggest that the Romans were conscious of potential threats from the local population and so sought to prepare themselves accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\nWhilst Binchester was primarily built to house cavalry regiments from across the Empire, a thriving vicus (civilian settlement) also grew outside of the fort’s gates. A once brightly-painted bathhouse with seven-foot walls, along with an inscribed alter to the goddess Fortuna, are some of the site’s most significant finds. Of particular interest are the well-persevered remains of the bathhouse’s hypocaust (underfloor heating) system, which provide an opportunity to view the most intact system of its kind in Britain. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/binchester-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Binchester\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 2 - Binchester Roman Fort <i>Source:durham.gov.uk/binchester </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nA second bathhouse, located outside of the fort, affords visitors the opportunity to see a Roman bathhouse in an even better state of preservation, with walls still standing to a height of six feet above Roman floor level. \r\nThe site is in the care of Durham County Council and is open every day between 1st April to 31st October.

However, some spaces are too narrow for walking frames. If you would like to borrow one of the museums custom wheelchairs, please call ahead and ask.\r\n<br><br> \r\nStandard wheelchairs are usually too big for the narrow corridors and doorways of the museum, so visitors with wheelchairs larger than 41cm wide, 84cm deep and a height of 82cm, will be asked to transfer to one of the museums specially manufactured narrow wheelchairs. The Museum can be narrow and difficult to manoeuvre in; so therefore, require that a member of staff pushes you throughout your visit.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSuch resources are limited so therefore, require that visitors with disabilities call at least 24 hours ahead.

The Water-Lily Pond (1899) By Claude-Oscar Monet </h4> <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/the-national-gallery-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"The National Gallery\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>The Water-Lily Pond <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the World’s most famous Impressionist artists, of course, Monet had to make an appearance amongst the must-see paintings at the National Gallery. Born in 1840 in Paris, France, Monet was a founder of French impressionist painting and practitioner of the movements philosophy of expressing one’s individual perception of nature- hence the unique and iconic style of painting which we all recognise in Monet’s work today. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs a result of this, Monet was heavily inspired by nature and created a variety of stunning pieces influenced by the beauty of his home in Giverny, The Water-Lily Pond which is currently on display at the National Gallery is in fact, one of those paintings. At the end of his life, Monet found the subject matter for his art in the gardens of his home, specifically, the water-lily pond and the beautiful Japanese Bridge he constructed across it. This piece is one of seventeen other paintings which Monet began to paint in 1899, which feature the beautiful pond and bridge. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2. Sunflowers (1888) By Vincent Van Gogh:</h4> <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/the-national-gallery-image3-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"The National Gallery\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Sunflowers (1888) By Vincent Van Gogh <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSticking with the impressionist theme, is this beautiful iconic painting by Vincent Van Gogh, a Dutch post-impressionist painter, who is one of he most famous and influential figures in the history of Western Art. Creating about 2,100 pieces of art in just ten years, Van Gogh’s paintings are characterised by their bold colours, expressive brush-strokes, and a tragic and complex personal history behind them. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBorn in 1853 in Zundert, Netherlands, Van Gogh had a history of Mental Illness and following a lack of commercial success when he was alive, he lived a life of poverty and subsequently committed suicide in 1890 aged just thirty-seven. Van Gogh painted Sunflowers in 1888, and the painting is primarily yellow- which he associated with hope and friendship.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nHe suggested that his four Sunflowers canvases express an ‘idea symbolising gratitude’, and was thought to have been pleased with the outcome, as he hung the painting in the guest bedroom of his home in Arles in anticipation of the arrival of his friend, Paul Gauguin (A French post-impressionistic artist)  \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h4>3. The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) By Jan Van Eyck </h4><p class=\"text-justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/the-national-gallery-image4-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"The National Gallery\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) By Jan Van Eyck <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPainted in 1434 by EARLY Netherlandish painter Jan Van Eyck, The Arnolfini Portrait is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art due to its beauty, iconography and picture space-with Eycks complex use of the mirror. Painted on an oak panel using oil paints, this portrait depicts Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife to record their wedding. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nArnolfini was a member of an Italian merchant family from Lucca, who was living in Bruges- the interior is well-appointed suggesting an element of wealth. A fun-fact about the painting is if you look closely, just above the mirror, there are words written in Latin, which basically translates to ‘Jan van Eyck was here, 1434’. This quirky feature is not accidental as Van Eyck would often inscribe his pictures in a witty way.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h4>Food and Drink facilities:</h4> <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nYes, there are food and drink facilities at the National Gallery. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe National Dining Rooms offer stunning views across Trafalgar Square and the Menu offers the best in British Produce. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe National Café offers all day dining, with a self-service Café. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThere is also an Espresso Bar which offers visitors a range of hot-drinks and cakes. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<h4>Tours:</h4> <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nA free daily guided tour is available daily from 2-3pm, which gives visitors a 60-minute taster tour of the collection.

St James’s Silk Damask: </h2> <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/william-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"William Morris Gallery\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>St James’s Silk Damask <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis beautifully striking piece of fabric holds an incredible and royal history! Designed by William Morris in 1883 this luxurious fabric was designed for the Armoury and Tapestry rooms in St James’s Place in London, which of course made it a firm favourite amongst his other customers as well. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe fabric had multiple uses, and could be used for wall-coverings, curtains or as a background for embroidery however, its most important use may very well be when the fabric was used to reupholster George V’s coronation throne in 1911! A copy of Morris and Co’s catalogue ‘The Coronation Thrones and Other Royal Furniture’ below the silk shows and image of the stunning reupholstered throne where the fabric most definitely is the most striking feature! \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>2.

Well, this chair is an incredible and ‘hidden’ piece of history, which through a modern-day eye is a discreet symbol of Morris’ rejection of Victorian convention and his interpretation of re-thinking furniture design. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis chair was a one-off and was designed by Morris’ for his London lodgings when he first moved to the city, and its solid construction and painted panels were designed to recreate a medieval look, which would continue to inspire Wallis’ creations. The chair was created to protest against the highly finished and elaborate designs of furniture which were in fashion during this time, and Morris’ attempt to create a unique yet classic design, which was to become the theme of the arts and crafts movement. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h2>3.

The woven mohair pile, stamped with floral designs, was a hardwearing fabric which made it suitable for upholstery. \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nIts design, colour and feel made it internationally appealing and a popular commercial choice, so it is therefore, unsurprising that it was used to furnish the first-class accommodations aboard the RMS Titanic in 1912. A section of the fabric can be seen on display at the Gallery, and above it a picture of a first-class cabin aboard the Titanic where the fabric stands out amongst the grandeur of the room. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/william-image4b-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"William Morris Gallery\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>The Titanic Fabric<i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Facilities for kids:</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nAs previously mentioned, this museum features interactive technology which is ideal for children, as well as interactive activities for children to engage with the processes used to create some of the objects apart of the arts and crafts movement and histories.

The first, Catacomb A, is located beneath the North Terrance Colonnade which is unfortunately now sealed off. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe second, Catacomb Z is beneath the Dissenters’ Chapel and suffered significant bomb damage during the Second World War which means it too, is closed to further deposits.  Lastly, located in the centre of the cemetery beneath the Anglican Chapel is Catacomb B, although this catacomb is currently not maintained by the cemetery staff, it can be visited as a part of a guided tour of the cemetery. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Chapel also has a working coffin-lift (catafalque) which was restored by The Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery in 1997.\r\n\r\n \r\n<h3>2.

Blondin toured the United States of American in 1885 and owed his fame to crossing the 1,100ft Niagara Falls Gorge on a tightrope in 1859. Blondin repeated this challenge several times, often including theatrical variations into the routine, such as being blindfolded, on stilts and even carrying a man (his manager Harry Colcord) on his back!\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1861 he appeared at the Crystal Palace in London, with a routine of somersaults on stilts again, on a tightrope and continued his routine throughout the UK. In 1897, Blondin sadly died of diabetes at the age of 72 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery alongside his second wife, Charlotte Lawrence. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>3.

When her father died, Princess Sophia was allowed greater freedom under the Regency of her brother, the Prince of Wales, although she still could not escape the royal institution through marriage. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSophia fell deeply in love with Major-General Thomas Garth who was a British Army officer and chief equerry to her father King George III, and it was believed that during the winter of 1799 at Windsor Castle Sophia conceived his illegitimate son Thomas Garth junior (1800-1873). \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn her final years, Sophia resided in the household of Princess Victoria of Kent (the future Queen Victoria) where Victoria’s infamous comptroller, Sir John Convoy, who took advantage of her senility and blindness by bullying her into spying on both the Kensington household, as well her two brothers, all whilst he stole most of her inheritance.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSophia sadly died in 1848 at Kensington Palace and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery upon her wish to be near her brother, Prince Augustus Frederick who lies on the opposite side of the path.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>5. Dissenters’ Chapel and The Reformers Memorial</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/kensal-green-image6-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Kensal Green Cemetery\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Dissenters’ Chapel and The Reformers Memorial <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nLocated in the E corner of the cemetery is the Greek revival ‘Dissenter Chapel’, which was built for all non-Anglican denominations/ non-believers. Since the cemetery was a favoured spot for nonconformists, free-thinkers and atheists etc, this chapel became the ‘it’ place for a number of them to be buried in, which was unique for the period. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe chapel is currently being used as the office for the Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery, however it can also be used for secular and dissenting funeral services. Following on from the Dissenters’ Chapel is The Reformers’ Memorial which was erected in 1885 by Joseph Corfield, in memorial ‘to the memory of men and women who had generously given their time and means to improve the conditions and enlarge the happiness of all classes of society’. \r\n<br><br>\r\nComprised of 75 social reformers and activists, the memorial is a testimony to a plethora of incredible people who used their positions to try a shape Victorian society for the better. The Reformers’ Memorial is located in the non-conformist section of the cemetery, which was created to be a burial area for those who did not conform to the governance of usages of the established Church of England. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAs previously mentioned, many of those ‘non-conformists’ were radicals, atheists such as Elizabeth Fry, William Cobbett and Robert Owen. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/kensal-green-image-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Kensal Green Cemetery\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Kensal Green Cemetary <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>', 'Kensal Green Cemetery', '2019-03-01 3:54 pm', 'kensal-green-image1-mobile.JPG', 'topics', '51.528066', '-0.2195541', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL),

The cemeteries unique blend of culture and architectural styles makes it a unique experience for visitors- lets get into some of these must-see sights that cannot be missed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nTop 5 must see sights of West Norwood Cemetery \r\n<h3>1.

Tate’s wealth grew from the success of his sugar and grocery business, and he soon became a member of the aristocracy who donated generously to charity. \r\n\r\n<br><br> \r\n\r\nIn 1889, Tate donated a collection of 65 contemporary paintings to the government on the condition that they be displayed in a gallery (towards which he donated £80,000 for them to build) The National Gallery of British Art (Now Tate Britain) was opened on 21st July 1897, and throughout his lifetime Tate continued to donate, often anonymously, to a plethora of causes he held passionate about.\r\n\r\n<br><br> \r\n\r\nA fun fact about the man behind the gallery is that he was made a Baronet in 1898, after continually refusing the title, because he was told the Royal Family would be offended if he refused it again! Sir Henry Tate is buried in a family mausoleum in the Cemetery, be sure not to miss this important figure of London’s history. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/west-norwood-image2b-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"West Norwood Cemetary\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Henry Tate <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>2.

The catacombs are laid out in six vault passages, which are comprised of 95 vaults with a capacity for 3500 coffins which are comprised of both private and shared loculi (which are coffin spaces). \r\n\r\n<br><br> \r\n\r\nIn the centre of the catacombs, there is a hydraulic catafalque which was a coffin lift designed by Bramah and Robinson in 1839 to transfer coffins from the chapel which was above them down into the catacombs for final burial. The Catacombs are not currently open to the public; however, tours are often available throughout the year- Be sure to check out the West Norwood Cemetery for more information about booking this tour.  \r\n\r\n<br><br> \r\n\r\n<h3>3. Henry Doulton (1820-1897)</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/west-norwood-image4-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"West Norwood Cemetary\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Henry Doulton <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother name readers may recognise is Henry Doulton, a Victorian inventor and manufacturer of pottery who was also an instrumental developer in the creation of Royal Doulton ceramics. Born in Vauxhall in 1820, Doulton was the second of eight children and the son of a potter manufacturer and business owner, to which Henry himself joined in 1835. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDoulton experimented with a variety of methods and styles of potter making, and in 1846 he superintended the manufacture of drainage and sanitary appliances in Lambeth which helped to make the firm famous. In 1870 the manufacture of ‘art pottery’ began in Lambeth, which joined together the skills of the students from the Lambeth Art school (now the City and Guilds of London Art School) where a variety of porcelains and earthenware was produced. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Doulton business continued to expand and prosper across the years, as did Doulton himself who received a knighthood in 1887 and also the Albert Medal by the Royal Society of Arts in 1885. Sadly however, Doulton died at his residence in London in 1897 and he was placed in a mausoleum in West Norwood Cemetery which is constructed from red pottery tiles and brick from the Doulton Works, which subsequently made it a Grade II listed building. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>4.

However, interestingly her surname \"Palaeologue\" takes its descent from the Byzantine Greek family who rose to nobility and produce the last ruling dynasty of the Byzantine Empire in the Duchy of Montferrat (an area in Northern Italy). \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nUpon further research, the Times Newspaper also seems to explore the mystery of Princess Eugenie claiming that had ‘descent from Constantine the Great, and who at one time laid claim to the throne of Greece’. Although very few records of this kind exist, I was able to uncover that Eugenie was married to Colonel Edmund H. Wickham (Royal Artillery) with whom she had four sons with, who sadly all died before her in the First World War and another who tragically drowned at Teddington Weir. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter suffering from ill-health for several years before, Princess Eugenie died in 1934 at the age of 86. Her funeral service was held at a Greek Church in Bayswater, from where she was taken to West Norwood Cemetery to be buried along side her husband and two of her four sons.<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/west-norwood-image5b-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"West Norwood Cemetary\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Princess Eugenie Palaeologue <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>5.

It has played an important role as the focal point for national celebrations and commemorations. The Palace measures 108 metres long by 120 metres deep, and it’s 24 metres high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>The Palace’s Origins</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe Palace originated as a townhouse known as Buckingham House, built in 1703 for the Duke of Buckingham. Sixty years later it was purchased by George III as a private residence for his wife, Queen Charlotte, and it became known as the Queen’s House.

Victoria used it as a family home and a place of entertainment, but after Prince Albert’s death in 1861 the Palace became somewhat neglected. On the accession of her son, Edward VII, to the throne in 1901, Buckingham Palace was revived as a place of royal entertaining and played a central role in ceremonial events throughout the twentieth century.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBuckingham Palace was a symbol of resilience during World War Two; George VI and Queen Mary remained in residence for the duration of the War and were home when a bomb hit a part of the east side in September 1940.

(81, 'Kensington Palace is a royal residence, separated into numerous apartments. The palace has its origins as a two-storey mansion built in 1605. In 1689 William and Mary ascended the throne and began searching for a residence away from the river Thames. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThey bought the mansion, known as Nottingham House, from the Earl of Nottingham. The architect, Christopher Wren, was called upon to enlarge the building, creating impressive hallways and ornate decor. As a favourite residence of the King and Queen, Kensington Palace was used to host parties and receive foreign ambassadors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBoth William and Mary died at the Palace; Mary from smallpox in 1694 and William from pneumonia in 1702. \r\nThe palace continued to be developed by subsequent monarchs. One of the palace’s most famous features, the Orangery, designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor, was constructed in Queen Anne’s reign. During George I’s reign new royal apartments and a grand staircase were added, decorated by William Kent. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe gardens were redesigned to include features we still see today – such as the Serpentine and the Round Pond. Under George II the palace was managed by Queen Caroline, who hosted lavish receptions and intellectual meetings, but after her death in 1737 it became neglected. George II died in the Palace in 1760, becoming the last reigning monarch to inhabit it. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/kensington-palace-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Kensington\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 1 - Bronze statue of William III in front of the South Front of the Palace <i>Source: Tony Hisgett, Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>The ‘Kensington System</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nQueen Victoria, the daughter of George III’s fourth son, was born in the palace in 1819 and spent her protective childhood there. Her controlled upbringing and education was known as the ‘Kensington System’. On 20th June 1837, an eighteen-year-old Victoria received the news that the King had died and she was now Queen. A few weeks later she moved to Buckingham Palace and her childhood home became the residence of minor members of the royal family. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/kensington-palace-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Kensington\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 2 - Queen Victoria receiving the news of her Accession in Kensington Palace <i>Source: Henry Tanworth Wells, 1887.

She lived there with her husband, the Prince of Wales, and it remained her official residence following their divorce. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt was also the childhood home of her sons, Princes William and Harry. On 31st August 1997 Kensington Palace became the focal point for national mourning after the death of Diana, with over one million flowers, some reaching around 5 feet (1.5 metres) deep, placed outside the gates by the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/kensington-palace-image3-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Kensington\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>igure 3 - Flowers outside Kensington Palace following the death of Princess Diana, 1997 <i>Source: Maxwell Hamilton, Wikicommons</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nToday Kensington Palace is notably the residence of Prince William and Kate Middleton, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, as well as other members of the Royal Family.

(82, 'St James’s Palace was built between 1531-1536 on the site of a former leper hospital dedicated to Saint James the Less, during the reign of Henry VIII. At the time of its construction Whitehall Palace, in nearby Westminster, was the official residence of the monarchy and St James’s was used as a more informal residence away from the bustle of the main court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe red-bricked palace is organised around courtyards (Ambassador’s Court, Engine Court, Friary Court and Colour Court) and is home to an impressive four-storey gatehouse, which was decorated with the initials “H” and “A” to symbolise the love of Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn.  Henry’s cipher “H.R.” can also be seen at the Tudor gatehouse on St. James’s Street.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe subsequent Tudor monarchs made use of the palace - most notably by Elizabeth I, who stayed on the eve of her speech to the troops awaiting the Spanish Armada.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/james_palace.jpg\" alt=\"James Palace\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 1 – The North Gatehouse on Pall Mall, St James\'s Palace <i>Source:Tony Hisgett, Wikicommons</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>St James’s Palace during the Stuarts and Hanoverians</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe seventeenth century was quite a dramatic period for St James’s Palace. It was here in 1649 that Charles I spent his final night before being executed at nearby Banqueting House (then part of Whitehall Palace). Oliver Cromwell later used the palace as barracks for his army. The palace also saw the birth of numerous monarchs - Charles II, James II, Mary II and Anne.\r\n \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century it made its transition to the official palace of the monarchy after a fire in 1691 burned down most of Whitehall Palace. Since 1707 the Proclamation Gallery in Friary Court at St James’s Palace has been the location of where the new monarch is announced following the death of the reigning monarch. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1809 a fire at St James’s contributed to the demise of its increasingly unsuitable living quarters, as well as a loss of a large part of the original Tudor interior. Shortly afterwards Buckingham House was purchased by George III, who spent his reign renovating it into a palace. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/james-palace-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"James Palace\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 2 - View of St James\'s in the time of Queen Anne (1702-1707)<i>Source: E, Walford, \'St James\'s Palace\', in Old and New London, Vol. 4 (London, 1878), pp. 100-122.

(83, 'The Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens is a Gothic Revival style monument designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott. It was commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1861 following the death of her husband Prince Albert. The memorial was opened in July 1872 and the seated statue of Albert was unveiled four years later. It was primarily funded by public subscription and cost £120,000 (about £10 million in today’s money). \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/albert-memorial-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Memorial\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 1 - The Albert Memorial in 1878 <i>Source: J.

Around the circumference of the main plinth is the Parnassus Freize, made up of 169 marble figures of painters, sculptors, poets, and musicians, including the likes of Handel, Shakespeare, and Chaucer. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn the spire are eight bronze statues symbolising the sciences – that of geometry, chemistry, geology, astronomy, philosophy, physiology, medicine and rhetoric; as well as eight statues representing the virtues, and two sets of angels. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/albert-memorial-image3-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Memorial\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 3 - Allegories of Victorian Industry: Commerce, Agriculture, Manufacture, and Engineering<i>Source: Wikimedia </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/albert-memorial-image4-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Memorial\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 4 - Figures representing Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Asia<i>Source: Wikimedia </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>Damage and Restoration</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe Albert statue was covered in black paint during World War One to avoid Zeppelin attacks, stripping it of its gold complexion until the end of the twentieth century.

(85, 'The Science Museum began its life as the Patent Office Museum, an exhibition of patented machinery and apparatus hosted in the South Kensington Museum, which had opened in 1857. The collections included some of the exciting new machines that had been on display at the Great Exhibition of 1851, but they also included some significant historical items.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThrough the efforts of the Bennet Woodcroft, the first superintendent, the collection grew to include the world’s earliest engines and locomotives, with the likes of Boulton and Watt beam engines (1780s), Puffing Billy (1814), and Stephenson’s ‘Rocket’ (1829).

It was not until 1909 that the science collections were officially separated as a new institution under the name the ‘Science Museum’. This separation had come after years of lobbying from the likes of Norman Lockyer, the founder of the science journal Nature, and Robert Morant, a civil servant. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThey had strongly advocated for a museum that was dedicated to science and industry. A year after its opening Hugh Bell was appointed as Chairman and he oversaw the first extensions to the site, which were hindered for a time by the First World War; the East Block was thus not opened until 1928. A children’s gallery was opened in 1931 complete with working models – an example of some of the earliest museum interactives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDuring the Second World War the museum was closed, and many of the collections were stored elsewhere. After the War many of the old buildings were demolished and new extensions were built. The 1970s saw the expansion of the institution to sites outside of London. The sites include The National Railway Museum in York, the National Museum of Photography (now the National Media Museum) in Bradford, and a storage facility at Wroughton, near Swindon. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>Opening times/access:</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nEntry to the Museum is free.

(86, 'The Victoria and Albert Museum (a.k.a. the V&A) is the world’s largest museum dedicated to design and the decorative arts, with around 145 galleries. The V&A has its origins in the Great Exhibition of 1851, held in Hyde Park. \r\n\r\n<br><br><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\nPrince Albert wanted to use the profit from the exhibition to fund permanent establishments dedicated to industrial education and the arts. The first fruit of his vision was the South Kensington Museum, opened to the public on 24th June 1857.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>The Early Years</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe Museum, in the Brompton area, was initially housed in a temporary building clad in sheets of iron, earning it the name the ‘Brompton Boilers.’ \r\n<br><br>\r\nIts original collections were formed of objects from industry, science, and the decorative arts. Henry Cole, the museum’s first director, used unique methods to encourage people to enjoy culture, he introduced three refreshment rooms to the museum, an unknown concept at the time, thus becoming the world’s first museum to have a restaurant. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe South Kensington Museum was also the first in the world to use gas lighting in the galleries, allowing for late night openings. Cole recognised that this gave the working class a more convenient time to enjoy culture, stating that “The evening opening of public museums may furnish a powerful antidote to the gin palace.”  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/vanda-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"V and A\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 1 - The Centre Refreshment Room (late 1860s) <i>Source: Museum no.

The ‘Brompton Boilers’ were dismantled in 1867 and re-erected in Bethnal Green. This is now the home of the V&A Museum of Childhood. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the 1890s an architectural competition was held to find someone to complete the museum, and the architect Aston Webb was chosen. He provided the designs for a new façade, new galleries and the entrance hall and rotunda. In 1899, in her last ever official public appearance, Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone for the new works and renamed the museum the Victoria and Albert Museum. The museum was completed in 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/vanda-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"V and A\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 2 - Bird’s eye view of the Aston Webb extension. <i>Source: © Victoria and Albert Museum, London. </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>The V&A in the twentieth century</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nDuring the Second World War many of the collections were moved elsewhere.

(87, 'Westminster Abbey, formally known as the Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster, is one of the principal religious places in the United Kingdom. It has been the place of coronation for monarchs since the Norman conquest of 1066, and has been used for royal burial and royal weddings. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Abbey’s early history</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nBenedictine monks occupied the site from the late 10th century and a stone church was added in the mid-11th century, during the reign of King Edward the Confessor, who became the first monarch to be buried in the abbey. It became known as the “west-minster” as opposed to the “east-minster”, that was St. Paul’s Cathedral. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Westminster-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Westminster\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 1 - Edward the Confessor\'s funeral procession in 1066, depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry <i>Source: The Bayeux Tapestry.

Ever since this time it has seen the coronation of every monarch of England, except Edward V and Edward VIII, who were never crowned. The Coronation Chair, also known as St. Edward’s Chair, is housed in the abbey and has been used at every coronation since 1308. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nNarrative and footage of the Coronation Chair at Westminster Abbey: \r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vawWBui4_kM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1245, under King Henry III, the building of the present church began, built in the new Anglo- French Gothic style. Traces of the original monastery, however, can still be found in the undercroft, which had served as the monk’s dormitory.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Westminster-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Westminster\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 2 - The Gothic-style North facade <i>Source: Wikicommons</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n \r\n<h3>What happened to Westminster Abbey during the Dissolution of the Monastries?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThere was a Benedictine monastery on site until the reign of Henry VIII, who dissolved the monasteries when he formed the Church of England. In 1560 the building relinquished its status as an abbey or cathedral and became a “Royal Peculiar”, meaning that the church was not under the jurisdiction of bishops and answered only to the sovereign. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nUnder Mary I (1556-1559), a Catholic Queen, the monastery was restored. This was short-lived, as on the succession of her Protestant sister, Elizabeth I, the Abbot and the monks were once again removed. The abbey was made a Collegiate Church, presided over by a dean and a chapter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>Memorial and burials</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe abbey is also the burial place of aristocrats, and persons associated with the church. Geoffrey Chaucer was buried in the cloisters, having been employed as master of the King’s Works. Since then an area known as Poets’ Corner has been the burial place of other literary and musical figures associated with the abbey. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Westminster-image3-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Westminster\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 3 - View of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the nave <i>Source: theartssociety.org</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practice of burying significant persons in the abbey later widened to include prominent national, political, literary and scientific figures; with the likes of Isaac Newton (1727), George Frederick Handel (1759), William Wilberforce (1833), Charles Dickens (1870), Charles Darwin (1882), and Stephen Hawking (2018).

She still yearned to be educated as a doctor and so she applied to the University of Edinburgh in March 1869 and despite the Medical Faculty and the Senatus Academus voting in favour of allowing her to study medicine the University Court declined her request, the reason given was they could not make the arrangements for the ‘interest of one lady’.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSophia Jex-Blake took things into her own hands and put advertisements in newspapers asking for other women interested in a medical career to apply with her. This sparked a little interest and by the summer of 1869 7 women applied and this time the University Court approved and the University of Edinburgh became the first British University to accept women. These women became known as the Edinburgh Seven, Britains first female medical students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/manor-place-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Manor Place\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Manor Place <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this was not the end of it, as the females demonstrated that they were every equal of the male students, animosity towards them began to grow and this culminated in the Surgeons Hall Riot on the 18th November 1890 when the women arrived to sit an anatmoy exam and an angry mob turned up hurling verbal abuse as well as rotten food and mud at them.  Under pressure from influential members of the Medical faculty the University was persuaded to refuse graduation to the women and referred the matter to the courts.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe courts declared that the women should never have been granted entry initially so their degrees were withdrawn.  This forced the women to attend universities across Europe who were already allowing women to graduate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSophia Jex-Blake earned her MD in 1877 from the University of Berne and 4 months later in Dublin she qualified as Licentiate of the King\'s and Queen\'s College of Physicians of Ireland (LKQCPI) meaning she could at last be registered with the General Medical Council, the third registered woman doctor in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/manor-place-image3-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Manor Place\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q><i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving gained her qualifications Jex-Blake returned to Edinburgh in 1878 perhaps as a snub to the establishment and at 4 Manor Place set up the first medical practice run by a woman in Scotland.

(98, 'Queen Victoria reigned from 20th June 1837 to 22nd January 1901. Her long reign, of 63 years and 2 months, oversaw unprecedented change in Britain; the growth of the British Empire and trade, developments in technology, science, medicine and public health, architectural and art movements, as well as political change and great societal shifts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDuring the Victorian period towns and cities grew at an unparalleled rate across Britain. At the start of Victoria’s reign London, the capital of the British Empire, was already the largest city in the world with a population of around 2 million, but by the end of her reign the population in the capital would rise to over 6.5 million. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>London’s Infrastructure in the 19th century</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\nThe streets were bustling with people - and horses; it’s estimated that 500,000 of them were required to transport London’s citizens via carriages, carts, omnibuses, and trams. Earlier periods had seen public transport as a luxury only the wealthy could afford but the increasing number of operators and forms of transport drove down costs so that people were being carted around the city in numbers never seen before. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe London and Greenwich Railway, the first passenger steam railway, was opened in 1838. The Victorian era also saw the building of Euston (1837), Paddington (1838), Waterloo (1848), King’s Cross (1850), and Victoria (1860) railway stations – they became gateways to the rest of the Kingdom, facilitating trade and the movement of people. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1855 the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW) was created to administer the new infrastructure needed to accommodate the growing city, by clearing slums, creating new streets, and providing parks. London increasing growth of population led to severe overcrowding in the inner-city and it began to expand into surrounding towns and villages, which today make up Greater London. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1863 London became home to the world’s first underground railway, providing residents with the opportunity to leave the busy inner-city and live in the suburbs; giving London a glimpse into the commuter lifestyle that characterises it today. The suburban dream was helped along in the latter end of the century by the Cheap Trains Act (1883), which made train travel cheaper. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the very poor were still confined to inner city slums, whilst the rising middle-class aspired to own their own homes in the suburbs. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\"> <br><sub><q>Figure 1 - Construction of the Metropolitan Railway, the world\'s first underground railway near King\'s Cross <i>Source: The Illustrated London News, Wikimedia. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>“London is a Modern Babylon”: Immigration to the capital</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nIn 1851, over a third of all Londoners were born somewhere else. Many came from the British countryside but there were also large communities of refugees from Europe. Europe at the time was bursting with revolutions and political debate, bringing to England political refugees, including the likes of political heavy-weights like Karl Marx.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Irish were the largest immigrant group as a result of the Irish Famine (1846-1849), and the London Jewish community expanded during the second half of the nineteenth century, fleeing wars, persecution and famine. Chinese, Indian, African, and Caribbean communities were also established by the London docks. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli referred to London as “a modern Babylon” due to the myriad of cultures and languages forming in the capital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 2 - The market at Petticoat Lane where Jewish cloth-makers sold their wares (1887) <i>Source: W. Thornbury, Old and New London, Vol.2 (London, 1887), p. 139. Credit: Archive.org. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>London at Work</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe Industrial Revolution (c.1760-c.1840) and the advent of steam ushered in the age of mass production, changing the market dramatically and aiding the expansion of a middling class of merchants, tradesmen and craftsmen. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nLondon was home to an abundance of trades, from cloth merchants to brewers. Among the important industries in London was furniture making, the chemical industry, the leather industry, and the clothing trade. Goods from all over the Empire were also bought to London via the docks, making it the centre of global trade. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt has been established by historians that the alteration of demographic structures had a profound effect on consumption patterns, especially with a national and international market developing alongside transport improvements. London wholesalers and manufacturers could now transport their goods across the country a lot cheaper and quicker than previous eras.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nLife for the working class during the great manufacturing boom, however, was poor. Many of the factories were unventilated centres of disease, and the working day was long and strenuous. People tended to work on a casual basis, thus workers’ rights were meagre. Social reformers sought to improve working conditions. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1847 The Factory Act was passed, also known as the Ten Hours Act, restricting the working hours of women and children in textile mills to 10 hours per day.  A significant break-through for workers’ rights was the legalisation of trade unions in 1871. The last decades of the century saw the rise of organised labour movements and strikes. \r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>London at Play</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nLeisure time became increasingly considered. The introduction of the railways opened up opportunities for travel across the country, giving rise to popular seaside resorts, race meetings and football matches. London itself became a destination for visitors with an expanding infrastructure of shops, theatres and music halls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nNotably, over 6 million people visited the Great Exhibition at Hyde Park in 1851. It was the first exhibition of technology and culture in the world. In the aftermath of the Exhibition, public money helped to establish a hub of national museums in South Kensington, giving home to many of the objects that had been on display, and places for citizens to visit in their leisure time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Great Exhibition has notoriously been defined as a turning point for Victorian Society. It certainly gave the average citizen a glimpse into a future filled with exciting commodities, and with an increase of 70 percent in real wages over the course of the century, broader members of society were able to afford the proliferation of goods on offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image3-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 3 - An interior view of the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, 1851 <i>Source: Joseph Nash (1851). Credit: The Royal Collection Trust. </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nShopping became a significant activity. Innovative retail practices arose in the period with the likes of elaborate window displays, sales pushes, fixed prices, and differing forms of advertising; as well as new forms of retail with the multi-national and department store. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWindow-shopping was a desirable pastime, with the likes of the Burlington and Piccadilly Arcades showing off luxury goods for the gentility. Merchants also began targeting middle-class women, who were now valuable consumers with buying power. Large department stores also kept on top of the latest technological innovations to promote their wares; In 1898 Harrods became home to England’s first escalator. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>A New Visual Age</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe advertising industry boomed in the Victorian period. Technological advances in printing meant that it was cheaper to produce publications on a larger scale than ever before, particularly with developments like the introduction of the steam-roller press. Communication advances, with the railway and the electric telegraph, alongside the growth of national literacy opened up the world of print to a mass readership. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the Victorian era new Copyright Laws were passed, giving authors’ royalties for their penmanship. The novel became a popular art form with the genres of romanticism and science fiction gaining ascendency, in part influenced by idealised notions of the rural past and fears for the urban future respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image4-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 4 - The famous Victorian actress Lillie Langtry on a Carte-de-Viste <i>Source: The London Stereoscopic & Photographic Company, 1880-1890. Credit: The National Portrait Gallery.</i></q></sub>\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn this environment, celebrity culture flourished. In 1856 the National Portrait Gallery opened its doors providing visitors with a glimpse of the powerful and fashionable.  A new form of visual media arose in the 1860s with the introduction of mass-produced portraits called carte-de-viste. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor the first time the public could own images of famous actors, actresses, literary figures, sportsmen, and the Royal Family at an affordable price. They were extremely popular collectors’ items, for example, an album of portraits of Victoria and Albert commissioned by the Queen in 1860 sold 60,000 copies in its first week on the market.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>Public Health</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nWhilst the Victorian era was a time of great economic boom and cultural progress it was also a time of great poverty. Social commentators like Charles Dickens and Edwin Chadwick bought to light the major downfalls of Victorian Society. For a time, Dickens lived a few doors away from the Cleveland Street Workhouse, which no doubt influenced his writings.  Living conditions were poor and many lacked basic facilities, like clean water. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSewage was dumped into the Thames River causing a great deal of pollution. This led to the ‘Great Stink’ of the 1858 and three outbreaks of cholera. In the second half of the nineteenth century the civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette designed a new sewage system for London to aid drainage, helping to save thousands of lives. His sewer system still operates today. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image5-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 5 - \'Father Thames Introducing his Offspring to the Fair City of London\' <i>Source: Punch, 3rd July 1858. Credit: The British Library. </i></q></sub>\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe likes of cholera, typhoid, typhus, influenza, scarlet fever, and smallpox were the most common diseases, with epidemics wiping out significant numbers of the population. Some epidemics were so serious that they led to legislation being passed, for example, the Nuisances Removal Act (1855) was implemented in reaction to the cholera epidemic of 1853-1854. The State began to seek new ways to manage poverty and disease and put into action an array of public health measures, including the Compulsory Vaccination Act (1853), which made it compulsory for all children to be vaccinated against smallpox during the first three months of their life. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nNot everyone looked kindly upon the efforts of an increasingly interventionist state, and there was organised anti-vaccination movements throughout the country. The death rate from smallpox, however, fell rapidly as a result of the legislation. In 1848 the first Medical Officer for London was appointed, producing annual reports and statistics on the state of public health in London.  For the first time the health of the population of London was systematically recorded. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Officer also had the authority to inspect factories, housing, foodstuffs. In 1889 the Notification of Diseases Act was passed, requiring that Medical Officers’ notify the centre of the outbreak of certain diseases. When a disease alert was in place the given locality would receive official advice, which was then disseminated out to the locals. By the end of the period better sanitation led to a steady decline in the mortality rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image6-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 6 - Cholera Notice for the Limehouse District <i>Source:  Printed Cholera Notice, 1866. London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Library & Archives.

Notably, in the 1890s Robert Koch identified the micro-organisms that caused tuberculosis, which was widely lauded in the scientific and lay press. Many of these breakthroughs, however, took time to impact the day-to-day lives of the poor.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>Civic Pride and Welfare</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nA number of moneyed entrepreneurs used their wealth for the public good, seeking to address the discord between rising living standards and poverty. An example of this civic engagement can be seen from Thomas Barnado, an Irishman, who came to London during an outbreak of cholera in the 1866, which swept through the East End. As a result of the cholera outbreak many families were left destitute and children were orphaned. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBarnardo set up the ‘Ragged School’, to provide poor children with an education, and in 1870 he opened his first home for boys in Stepney Causeway. The Peabody Trust was also formed in the 1860’s, by the American banker George Peabody. The trust provided purpose-built housing for the poor, with the first block opened in 1864 in Spitalfields, containing 57 dwellings. Numerous other charities were formed in the period, such as the Charity Organisation Society and the Salvation Army. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWelfare was provided through voluntary and charitable organisations, whilst the State offered the destitute the Workhouse. The Poor Law Amendment Act (1834) tried to reconcile economic astuteness with humanitarian aid, seeking to define the ‘deserving poor’ by creating a system that dissuaded people from seeking relief. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere were a high number of workhouses in the capital, one of the largest was at St. Martin in the Fields in Westminster; In 1865 The Lancet, a medical journal, reported on the overcrowding and the neglect of paupers in their sick wards. The reports prompted discussion about failures of the workhouse system and helped lead to the passing of the Metropolitan Poor Act in 1867, which created the Metropolitan Asylum Board and provided a new system of care for the sick poor in the capital.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>Political and social ideologies</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe extensive demographic, social, and economic changes since the beginning of the nineteenth century gave rise to new social theories and political movements. In 1859 Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species was published. Victorian thinkers used the theory of evolution for their own ends, applying it to ideas of race, class and British Imperialistic ‘progression’. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs the urban environment had led to such an array of health problems concerns over ‘de-evolution’ or physical degeneration abounded. There was anxiety that civilisation had reached its peak and would revert to a more primitive state. These fears were relayed in popular literature of the period, with the likes of R. L. Stevenson’s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886) and H. G. Wells’s The Time Machine (1895). \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n \r\nPolitical movements like socialism and liberalism were prominent in the period. Chartism was a working-class movement in Victoria’s early reign that sought to give more men representation in the House of Commons through the vote. The 1832, 1867, and 1884–85 Reform Acts extended voting rights to broader members of the population, not just those in the upper-classes of society. The Labour movement also began in the nineteenth century, with reformers aiming to improve the socio-economic realities of the lower-classes. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image7-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 7 - Daguerreotype of a large crowd of supporters of the Chartist movement gathered together on Kennington Common, 1848. <i>Source: Prince Albert purchased two daguerreotypes of the meeting in 1848.

In 1820, whilst she was still a baby, both her father and George III died. After the death of two of her uncles she became the sole heir to her Uncle, William IV, who had no children. Victoria was raised in Kensington Palace by her mother and had a controlled upbringing. At the age of 18 her Uncle, William IV passed away and Victoria succeeded the throne. Her official residence became Buckingham Palace.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image8-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 8 - Queen Victoria as a young woman, by F.W.

She immediately turned away from her controlling mother and looked for other figures to provide support. Her first Prime Minister Lord Melbourne became a friend and confidant. Victoria first met her future husband Albert in 1839 and they were married a year later. Over the course of the next sixteen years they would have nine children. Notably, Victoria was administered chloroform, an anaesthetic, for the birth of her eighth child, Prince Leopold. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h4>Civic Duty:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nVictoria and Albert undertook a significant number of civic duties, visiting hospitals, towns and supporting charities. Prince Albert developed a reputation for helping public causes, and in 1851 he was prominent in the organisation of the Great Exhibition. The Queen introduced the ‘Victoria Cross’ to honour soldiers’ bravery in the Crimean War, basing it on merit rather than rank. 62 men were presented with the medal in the 1857. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h4>Albert’s Death:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nIn the Winter of 1861 Albert died from Typhoid. The Queen was devastated and wore mourning clothes for the rest of her life. It would be almost a decade before the Queen partook in public engagements. Victoria commissioned a large number of memorials for Prince Albert, including the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image9-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 9 - Queen Victoria and Princess Alice in mourning. <i>Source: See,H.

In 1876 Victoria gained the title Empress of India, which bolstered her popularity and feelings of patriotism. The image of Britannia became a potent image in popular culture and advertising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image10-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 10 - Queen Victoria as Empress of India, 1876. <i>Source: W & D Downey Photographers.

The historian David Cannadine commented on the use of spectacle to legitimise the existence of the monarchy and the increased frequency of royal ceremonies in the Victorian era.\r\n<br><br>\r\nVictoria’s long reign also helped to garner popularity. On 20th July 1887 Victoria’s Golden Jubilee was marked with celebrations across the Empire. Soldiers from these disparate nations marched through London and a feast was held for foreign envoys and representatives. Victoria’s image was disseminated on mass-produced commemorative items, from mugs to postcards.  The commercial sector capitalised on the image of Victoria, appealing to patriotism to sell commodities. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image11-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 11 - Victoria\'s image used to sell Golfer Oats. <i>Source: John Johnson Collection.

When the Queen died she ruled over 400 million subjects, a quarter of the world’s population. She became the image of British Imperial power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nVictoria passed away in January 1901, aged 81. The Queen’s funeral was an elaborate affair, attended by European Royalty and marked with pageantry. Victoria’s reign had coincided with the advent of photography, and had seen unparalleled transformations in the social, economic, political and technological make-up of society. Fittingly, her funeral was at that time the largest event ever caught on the new medium of film.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nFilm reel of Queen Victoria’s funeral: https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-funeral-of-queen-victoria-1901-1901-online\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Timeline of events during Queen Victoria’s reign: 1837 – 1901</h3>\r\n<font size=\"+1\">\r\n1837<br>William IV dies and Victoria is crowned Queen, aged 18. \r\n<br><br>\r\n1837<br>Lord Melbourne is Prime Minister - the first of ten Prime Ministers’ during Victoria’s reign.\r\n<br><br>\r\n1837<br>Chartism begins, a working-class political movement seeking political reform.\r\n<br><br>\r\n1837<br>Charles Dicken’s first novel Pickwick Papers is published as a book, after it first appeared serialised.\r\n<br> <br>\r\n1838<br>The London and Greenwich Railway is opened, the first passenger steam railway in the capital.\r\n<br><br>\r\n1839<br>The start of the First Anglo-Afghan War.\r\n<br><br>\r\n1839<br> The First Opium War begins. \r\n<br><br>\r\n1840 <br> Victoria marries Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in the Chapel Royal in St. James’ Palace.\r\n<br><br>\r\n1840<br> The Penny Post is introduced, revolutionising the postal system.\r\n<br><br>\r\n1841 <br> Robert Peel becomes Prime Minister.\r\n<br><br>\r\n1842 <br> End of the First Opium War.

(99, 'Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland and a city that nearly half a million people call home.  In fact, people have been calling this fantastic location ‘home’ according to archaeological finds, as far back as 8500 BCE (the Mesolithic Period). \r\n\r\n<br><br><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\nTraces of later Bronze and Iron Age settlements have been found in the area, most notably on Castle Hill (the hill that leads up to Edinburgh Castle) and Arthurs Seat, the extinct volcano that sits within the boundaries of Holyrood Park.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see what attracted people to these sites as they are both commanding locations in relation to the surrounding countryside and they are within a short distance of the sea. And so, it became that this valuable real estate was fought over frequently throughout history, initially between local Celtic tribes, then towards the end of the first century by the Romans who marched in and claimed it as their own, displacing the Celtic tribe known as the Votadini.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/edinburg-main-image4-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Edinburgh\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Edinburgh <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nBy 211CE the Romans had retreated south behind Hadrians Wall and eventually left Britain for good in 411CE.  \r\nThe next 700 years was a tumultuous time for the country as a whole.  Various Kingdoms fought over its ownership and there was no stability until King David I of Scotland (Alba) defeated his nephew to claim the Kingdom of Scotland as his own and introduced feudalism into the Scottish psyche.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis period is referred to as the Davidian Revolution by scholars to summarise the changes that took place.  Part of this revolution was the foundation of ‘royal burghs’ of which Edinburgh was the most prominent.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDuring David I’s reign a royal castle was built at the top of Castle Hill replacing the old fort that had dominated its heights previously. He also founded Holyrood Abbey a mile away from the castle. A road sprung up between the two sites known as the Royal Mile and it is from this road that the modern shape of Edinburgh started to grow from. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/edinburg-main-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"EdinBurgh\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Edinburgh <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city’s oldest surviving building is St Margaret’s Chapel that is within the walls of Edinburgh Castle at its highest summit and was believed to have been built in the 12th Century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDuring the Wars of Independence, a series of military campaigns fought between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries the city changed hands numerous times and suffered a lot of damage.  The castle itself was captured by the English between 1296 and 1322 and in 1385 the Cathedral and Town Hall were burnt down.  Despite this the city still thrived and became famous for its main exports of wool and leather which were shipped out from the Port of Leith.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter defeat at the Battle of Flodden against the English in 1513, the inhabitants of the city built the Flodden Wall to protect themselves. However, the wall was not very effective and the English would breach it to attack the city on several more occasions. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt this time approximately 12000 people lived within the boundaries of Edinburgh but the population was expanding rapidly and it wasn’t long before the Royal Mile started to get built up as expansion was impossible due to the city walls hemming them in and soon multi-story houses, some up to 12 stories high began to line the roads.  A feature of the Royal Mile is these high-rise dwellings that soar above you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/edinburg-main-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Edinburgh\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Edinburgh <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1707 the Act of Union was signed and united the Kingdoms of England and Scotland which became the United Kingdom.\r\nEdinburgh continued to thrive and its population grew rapidly to such an extent that Daniel Defoe the English author of Robinson Crusoe commented on his visit that ‘in no city in the world [do] so many people live in so little room as in Edinburgh’.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis high population in cramped conditions made the whole place extremely unhealthy with bubonic plague, typhus and cholera problems that were faced on a daily basis by many people. Where Princes Street Gardens are now used to be known as the Nor Loch and was where the effluent and waste water were thrown by the residents of the Old Town. Edinburgh was one of the most unsanitary towns in Europe. But this was soon to change as the Nor Loch was drained and a massive development project began.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the 18th Century the city was at the centre of the Scottish Enlightenment and became known as the Athens of the North due to its neo-classical buildings and reputation for education. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBuilt in several stages from the 1760s to the 1830s, the New Town of Edinburgh was the largest planned city development in the world at that time, and it proved an outstanding success in bringing commercial and cultural dynamism to the city. It attracted the rich and powerful businessmen who had forsaken the Old Town for London to return to the new Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/edinburg-main-image3-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Edinburgh\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Edinburgh <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA new vibrant Edinburgh coupled with the Scottish Enlightenment that was sweeping Scotland between the late 18th and early 19th Century created huge advances in philosophy, political economy, engineering, architecture, medicine, geology, archaeology, law, agriculture, chemistry and sociology put Edinburgh and her universities firmly on the map. It was the place to be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDue to the Act of Union in 1707 the city was no longer restricted by its surrounding defensive walls and it quickly began to see growth in all directions.  By the end of the 19th Century nearly a quarter of a million people lived in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt became a centre of finance and trade.  The New Town had been built, the Old Town was getting upgraded to improve living conditions, Princes Street and surrounding areas were awash with new businesses and commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis expansion and improvement has continued to the present day, a new financial district has sprung up and Edinburgh is now recognised as the second largest financial and administrative centre after London.  The city also houses the Scottish Government who are responsible for governing Scotland and has done so since the Scotland Act of 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a fleeting introduction to Edinburgh throughout its history and with the help of the Hidden History App you really can turn the streets you walk on into the museum you never knew existed.  The Old and New Towns of Edinburgh were added to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation\'s (UNESCO\'s) list of World Heritage sites in 1995.  So, go and explore more of this fantastic city!\r\n \r\n', 'Edinburgh', '2019-03-01 3:54 pm', 'edinburgh-main.jpg', 'topics', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL);

The problem is that as the world speeds up the time and desire to look backwards decreases and the lessons that history offers us are being lost, ignored or missed. And we want to change that by redefining everyone’s relationship with history through creating exciting and immersive experiences that bring the past to life. \r\n<br></br>\r\nHidden History offers a new way for you to engage with the past by turning the streets your walk along into the museum you never knew existed. The Hidden History app will guide you to points of interest and with the help of technology and a little bit of creativity, we will bring each location to life. You will leave each location with enough information from all sides of the event to enable you to draw your own conclusions about what it tells you about our world today and what it could mean about tomorrow.\r\n<br></br>\r\nHidden History is ideal for anyone who enjoys finding hidden ‘secrets’, finding new ideas and likes to explore a city’s hidden past freely and independently. \r\n<br></br>\r\nWe hope you enjoy Hidden History. \r\n\r\n');

Although currently closed for the renovation, tours are believed to be resuming in 2020 if everything goes to schedule. The tower was designed by the rather grand sounding Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, an English architect who also designed the interior of the Palace of Westminster as well as churches in England, Ireland and as far away as Australia.

Around twenty earthen burial mounds make up the cemetery and, while they may seem unremarkable from the surface, archaeologists have discovered far more beneath the surface. These mounds were designed to be seen and to make a statement about the status of the individuals interred beneath them. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many of the mounds were damaged as a result of being robbed during the Tudor period – something which is woefully common for visible burial mounds as they would often be looted in pursuit of ‘treasure’. Since then, however, numerous investigations have taken place surrounding the mounds. The first proper excavation was conducted in 1939 by self-taught archaeologist Basil Brown, commissioned and organised by the landowner, Edith Pretty. It was this first dig that uncovered the great ship burial of Mound One and made Sutton Hoo a centre of archaeological exploration ever since. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Slim Statue\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Helmet from the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, England. 7th century AD.<i>Source: British Museum // Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Burial Mounds</h3>\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the mounds is Mound One, where an immense 90ft ship burial was first unearthed in 1939. There are actually two ship burials at Sutton Hoo - the lesser known being under Mound Two. Unfortunately, this burial was disturbed by looters, but iron ship rivets reveal the presence of a small boat under the mound. This style of burial reflected contemporary practices in 7th century Sweden, showing a connection between Anglo Saxons in (what is now known as) East Anglia and cultures elsewhere in northern Europe. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe funerals would’ve been “performative” with lavish grave goods, ceremony and the construction of the immense mounds would have been made by hand. Not only was the burial packed with an abundance of rich grave goods, but the committal of an entire ship to the ground would have been an amazing spectacle. It would have cemented in their memory the royal status and significance of the individual buried. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Slim Statue\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q> Burial mound at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, UK. This mound has been reconstructed to its supposed original height.<i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot be sure exactly who was buried, it is generally accepted that this is the likely resting place of Rædwald, ruler of the East Angles and the first king to rule as overlord over England as a whole. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAccording to Bede’s Historia Ecclesiastica, Rædwald was amongst the earliest Anglo Saxon rulers in England to be baptised and he is credited with playing a significant role in the establishment of Christianity within the ruling classes. His new faith, however, earned the disapproval of his household and queen, who tried to coax him back to his pagan Gods (Plunkett 2005). \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nRædwald maintained elements of his pagan lifestyle and allowed the East Angles to worship both the Christian and the traditional Anglo-Saxon religions if they desired, something the devout Bede criticised him for. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a result of the immense wealth, status and religious associations of the individual under Mound One, it’s clear to see why Rædwald is such a strong candidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Artefacts in focus</h3> \r\n\r\nFortunately, not all the mounds were looted and this meant that, upon excavation, archaeologists uncovered a trove of rich grave goods in their original position. These grave goods (objects placed in a grave alongside a body) can be used to give us an insight into the wealth of the individual. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nFor example, the grave is full of military equipment and valuable weapons, indicating their role as a warrior king within Anglo Saxon society. Similar equipment is found underneath Mound Seventeen, where a young warrior is poignantly buried alongside their horse and an abundance of weapons – their horse would have been sacrificed for the funeral which would have been a spectacular albeit grisly ritual display.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nChristian faith is also demonstrated in several of the items that accompanied the individual to the grave. These objects are amongst the main reasons that the grave is thought to belong to Rædwald. As religious beliefs can play such a huge part in people’s understanding of death and the afterlife, objects with religious motifs and associations are common finds, especially at times of religious transition such as Anglo Saxon period. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image4-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Slim Statue\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q> Burial chamber of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, England. Reconstruction shown in the Sutton Hoo Exhibition Hall.<i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, ten nested silver bowls from the Eastern Empire were found alongside two Byzantium silver spoons with the names of the Apostles ‘Paul’ and ‘Saul’ engraved on them, in Greek. These are suggested to be possible baptismal gifts, buried as a symbol of Rædwald’s conversion to Christianity. There are also symbols of crosses on brooches, and a secret chamber hidden in the back of the gold Great Buckle that may have housed a Christian relic. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe Great Buckle is an incredible example of master goldsmithing, with interwoven ribbon animal decoration and fine detailing. Perhaps the most exquisite artefacts found in the grave are a pair of fine filigree worked shoulder clasps, inlayed with garnets, millefiori designs, interlacing ribbon animal decoration and filigree surrounds. The motifs on the buckle are packed full of Anglo Saxon symbolism, cementing Rædwald’s cultural identity.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe Sutton Hoo helmet is perhaps the most recognisable artefact from the grave. As well as its striking appearance and precious materials, it is laden with symbolism. It has been argued that the helmet makes reference to one-eyed Odin from Norse Mythology (Price and Mortimer 2014), due to imagery represented across northern Europe. If you look closely, you will notice a deliberate absence of gold foils over the left eye of the helmet and over the left eye of an animal head near the crow. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image5-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Slim Statue\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Sutton Hoo helmet reconstructed.<i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the low light of a feasting hall, this would result in the illumination of the right eye, and the casting of a shadow over the left – a powerful allusion to Odin and possibly declaring the wearer to be of the same status as the pagan god.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe placement of drinking horns (a common Anglo Saxon grave good) in the grave may have also served to create an image of the “worthy dead” (Pollington 2011: 21) as the possession and use of feasting equipment marked an individual’s place within society. The feasting equipment and lyre paint an image of a mead hall, full of music and celebration, with Rædwald as the gracious host. The funeral itself may have included some mead-fuelled celebration of the life of the deceased. Evidence of funerary feasting at the grave-side is common at Anglo Saxon burial sites (Lee 2007), and it may have been part of a transitionary ritual to aid passing into the afterlife.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>‘Ghosts’ in the sand</h3> \r\n\r\n\r\n\'Taphonomy’ is the study of the preservation, decay or changes to archaeological material after it has been deposited in the ground. A detailed, forensic approach to excavation and study of excavated material allows archaeologists to reconstruct the story of what has happened to organic material before, during and after burial. Soil conditions, burrowing animals, climate and even gnawing dogs can have a huge impact on survival of organic material.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAt Sutton Hoo, the acidic soil conditions meant that the great oak ship did not survive its 1400 years in the soil and the bones of Rædwald had long-since decayed. How, then, did archaeologists claim to ‘find’ the great ship burial and burials? \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image6-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Slim Statue\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Sand Bodies of Sutton Hoo.<i>Source: P.M.Sabin Moore Blog </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n‘Ghosts’ of the organic materials appeared as staining in the acidic yellow sand - archaeologists have to have a keen eye for changes in soil colour and texture, so they were able to spot these anomalies and excavate around them, creating ‘sand people’ (similar in appearance to some of the Pompeii casts) or identifying the structure of the ship. These were inhumation burials, but cremation burials were also uncovered at Sutton Hoo. Cremations are likely to have been the earliest at the site (Carver 1998) and are found under several mounds, as well as in the surrounding area. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAs well as visible staining, decaying organic material can leave invisible traces of phosphates in the soil. In 1967, soil analysis from Mound One revealed a significant spike in the phosphate levels, indicating that there had once been a body in the grave but it had dissolved in the acidic environment.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Visiting Sutton Hoo</h3> \r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image7-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Slim Statue\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Sutton Hoo Exhibition Hall with Helmet sculpture. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nMany of the artefacts from across the Sutton Hoo site can be seen in the British Museum, but replicas and original are also housed in the Sutton Hoo visitor centre. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to a development project currently being undertaken at the National Trust site, the visitor centre and cemetery reopen to the public from late spring to early summer of 2019.

After the death of Mary Jane Kelly on the 9th November, the murders seemed to desist, but Whitechapel was still far from safe. On 17th July 1889, a body was found at 12:50am in Castle Alley. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nNowadays, the site is on the west pavement where Pomell Way meets Old Castle Street. Alice McKenzie was around 40 years old when she was killed under a gas street lamp here. It rained shortly after she was abandoned. She had earned the nickname Clay Pipe due to her penchant for smoking and indeed, her clay pipe was found underneath her body.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nPolicemen vigilantly patrolled through this alley on their beats and rarely left it unattended for more than five minutes, meaning whoever took Alice’s life knew the schedules of the police rounds. In typical Whitechapel murder fashion, there was no trace nor any clue as to who the killer was or where they had escaped to. A resident of the washhouse, the back of which faced the murder, said she heard nothing until the police whistle and someone knock on her door. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice’s injuries were eerily similar to the victims of Jack the Ripper: her throat had been cut, her skirts crumpled up beneath her chin to reveal abdominal cuts. These wounds, however, were not as deep as the ones inflicted the year before. Given the climactic severity of the wounds found on Mary Kelly, this lighter touch with Alice seems highly dubious. Dr Bagster Phillips, who also attended the examinations of Mary Jane Kelly, Annie Chapman, and Elizabeth Stride, attested that the cause of death was blood loss not strangulation as in the previous cases, and also the injuries were unlike what he had seen before.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAt the inquest, the coroner revealed that if this wasn’t the work of Jack the Ripper, it was likely a copycat. This opinion is echoed in the East London Observer which also notes that Alice matched many criteria of the Ripper crimes, including living in a lodging house and being a prostitute. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAlice’s profession has not been confirmed however and her partner of six years, John McCormack as well as an acquaintance, Margaret Franklin, claimed that she was a washerwoman and charwoman in the Jewish community which was predominant in this area.

It is alleged that she suffered from fits, precisely why we do not know, but her later partner, Henry Turner, knew that the fits were exacerbated by drinking. Henry Tabram gave her 12 shillings for three years before reducing it to half a crown (2s 6d). This harsh deduction was due to the fact that Martha was living with Henry Turner, who worked as a carpenter.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nShe was living at Satchell’s Lodging House at 19 George Street in Spitalfields in August 1888 and was working on the streets that evening.

There is still debate as to whether Martha was a victim of Jack the Ripper as the majority of her wounds were to her stomach and groin, which became a “trademark” of the murderer. Furthermore, a large cut about 3x1 inches was incised into her abdomen. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nShe was stabbed a total of 39 times with a small blade. As there were no signs of strangulation as would be typical of a Ripper victim, it was concluded that she died of blood loss.

In Summer 1888, Joseph lost his job and couldn’t support Mary anymore; she turned to prostitution and their relationship fell apart. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nJoseph continued to visit and send her money as often as possible.

Some hours later, Sadler was attacked and robbed in Thrawl Street whilst Frances stood by idly. Her lack of intervention led to an argument and the couple went their separate ways. Both ended up at their lodging house although neither could pay for the night, so they were forced to leave by 12:30am on the 13th.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/frances-coles-image2.jpg\" alt=\"Frances Coles\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <sub><q>The Latest Mysterious murder of Whitechapel. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 1:45am, Frances met with a colleague, Ellen Calana (also seen as Callana, Callanan, or Callagher) on Commercial Street. A man approached Ellen with a view to solicit her, however when she declined, he punched her and left her with a black eye. Undeterred, he solicited Frances who went with the man towards Minories, now Tower Gateway station. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nShe was found with her throat cut and barely alive at 2:15am by PC Ernest Thompson in Swallow Gardens - a walkway beneath the railway arch between Chamber Street and Royal Mint Street. He heard a man’s footsteps walk off in the distance but due to legal procedure, he had to remain with Frances.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/frances-coles-image3.jpg\" alt=\"Frances Coles\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <sub><q>Railway Arch where she was murdered. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nA man named Duncan Campbell bought a knife from Sadler on Friday morning for 1 shilling. He noted that the handle was clammy and the blade stained, so he washed it, but noticed the water had reddened. Sadler was arrested for Frances’ murder the next day and was charged on the 24th February but was cleared a week later.

The current design is based on the original. There is no particular record of when the original and sizeable circular seating area around disappeared from Parliament Hill Fields, however there was a post-war carbuncle that was certainly in operation in the current location from the 1950’s.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/bandstand_at_parliament_hill_hidden_history.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament Hill\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The bandstand that stands today was actually built in the 1990’s as the original was rundown. <i>Source: Julian Osley / Bandstand, Parliament Hill Fields</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nIn the late 1960’s Camden Council organised a series of free concerts at the bandstand. Beginning in September 1968, on a rainy Wednesday the Jefferson Airplane and Fairport Convention played to only a few hundred tuned-in people.

The band were squeezed into the corrugated iron shed while battling the feedback from their PA. <mark>The following week the crowd doubled in size.</mark>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nThis was partly due to John Peel mentioning the events on his radio shows and by week three Fleetwood Mac played with 25,000 people turning up.

He, like many wealthy people in the late Victorian period, believed in the need for social reform for the poor in England, and in turn saw a need to actively remember the heroism of ‘ordinary’ people. In his letter he wrote:\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<mark> “The character of a nation as a people of great deeds is one, it appears to me, that should never be lost sight of. It must surely be a matter of regret when names worthy to be remembered and stories stimulating and instructive are allowed to be forgotten… It is not too much to say that the history of Her Majesty’s reign would gain a lustre were the nation to erect a monument, say, here in London, to record the names of these likely to be forgotten heroes”. <small> George Frederic Watts</small>\r\n</mark>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/George_Frederic_Watts\'s_Memorial_to_Heroic_Self_Sacrifice.jpg\" alt=\"The Watts Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nDespite this initial suggestion for the memorial, it wasn’t officially opened until 30 July 1900. In 1898, Watts was invited by the vicar of St Botolph’s church – the space being their former churchyard – to create the monument in the now public park. So, in 1899 the construction began of the 50ft long 9ft high shelter by J. Simpson and Son for the tablets at the cost of £402. Benches were also installed to encourage the public to stay a little longer. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpace was made available for 120 tablets (in rows of 24), though only 54 tablets have been installed so far. Each tablet is made up of small tiles and records the name(s) of the deceased with the details and date of the events making them worthy of remembrance. Only 4 of these plaques were installed when the monument was opened. The remainder of the first row included 9 installed in 1902, and 11 more along with T. H. Wren’s memorial to Watts in 1905 following his death the year before. All 24 of these tablets were designed by the ceramicist William De Morgan. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Postman\'s_Park_Wall_of_Heroes.jpg\" alt=\"The Watts Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nA further 29 tablets were designed by Royal Doulton, 24 of which were installed altogether in 1908 filling a second row. Another 5 Doulton-style tablets were added on the next row from 1919-1930, which included replacement of a De Morgan tablet with incorrect information. A further tablet in the original De Morgan style created by Fred Passenger was slotted into the old spot for the incorrect tablet in 1931. Finally, the 54th tablet was added much later in 2009, commemorating Leigh Pitt who died saving a boy from drowning in 2007.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nOne of the people featured in the memorial is Alice Ayres, who died in 1885 while trying to save three children under her care from an upper-story of a burning house. Two of the three children survived, and Alice died in the process of trying to save herself as she fell awkwardly after jumping out the window. She was one of the most famous additions to the memorial and had already been commemorated in other ways across the country around the time of her death – this included in memorials, artwork and a street was renamed after her near to where she died on Union Street in 1936.

(1, 'The Windrush Generation', 'In 1948, the British Nationality Act declared that all Commonwealth citizens (inhabitants of former British colonies), had the right to <mark>freely enter and settle in Britain</mark>. Due to the ‘depressed economic situation’ in Jamaica at this time, when an advertisement in the Daily Gleaner offered passage to Britain for £28.10, many West Indians seized the chance to seek further employment and education opportunities in the ‘Mother country’.  Following a 22-day journey from Jamaica, on June 22nd 1948, the SS Empire Windrush arrived in Britain, docking just outside of London in Tilbury, Essex.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Empire-Windrush.jpg\" alt=\"Windrush Generation\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The \'Empire Windrush\' arriving in London, England in 1948 bringing Immigrants from the Caribbean to the UK. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nStarting life as a German cruise boat, the Empire Windrush eventually wound up in Kingston, Jamaica, where it then set sail for the British Isles, officially carrying 492 Caribbean passengers, although this number is believed to be greater as the ship contained a number of stowaways. \r\n<br></br>\r\nOf this number, many had already visited British shores - 120 were in fact ex-servicemen who had fought with British forces during the war. As post-war prosperity kicked-in, British industry found itself lacking the manpower to meet economic expansion. <mark>Many British employers thus looked to the former colonies in order to supply the labour</mark> needed to facilitate the rejuvenation of British industry.\r\n<br></br>\r\n<h2>From Jamaica to Britain</h2>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nPassengers of the Empire Windrush and those that were to follow, set their sights on the British Isles for a number of reasons. For many, like Clinton Edwards who had served with the RAF during the war, “the opportunity for jobs was better than back home”. Arthur Curling, also a former member of the British Airforce, felt that after his experience of traveling outside of the Caribbean, Jamaica simply felt “too small”. Whilst many intended to settle in Britain permanently, others planned to move back after learning a trade or simply viewed Britain as a stepping stone on their way to America. But regardless of individual motivations for the journey, for those undertaking the now historic voyage, <mark>coming to Britain represented the start of a new chapter</mark>. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/WINDRUSH-GENERATION.jpg\" alt=\"Windrush Generation\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Jamaican immigrants welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship HMT ‘Empire Windrush’ landed them at Tilbury. <i>(Picture: PA)</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nPrior to entering Britain, many passengers had self-organised employment and accommodation.  With the government apparently keen to ‘disperse’ the newcomers as quickly as possible, upon arrival those who had made such prior arrangements were issued free travel permits to get to them where they needed to go.\r\n<br></br>\r\nThose without such plans were transported from Tilbury to London and hastily sheltered at the <mark>Deep Shelter at Clapham South</mark>, which had been re-opened for the purpose.  180 steps below ground, this subterranean shelter had previously acted as a place of refuge for many Londoners during the blitz.  But in 1948, at the behest of the Colonial Office, it became the temporary home of 236 expectant individuals.\r\n<br></br>\r\nAt the opening of the shelter, the newcomers were greeted by a welcome tent where each resident was ‘checked-in’, allocated a bunk and issued with a blanket and linen sheet.  After descending into what one passenger described as “the bowels of South London,” the group became acquainted with their first British home-base.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/clapham_south_old9.jpg\" alt=\"Clapham South\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Jamaican immigrants using the shelter as a hostel in July 1948. <i>Source: subbrit.org.uk</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nFortunately, few of the deep shelter’s new inhabitants were subjected to these surroundings for too long. Utilising the local labour exchange in Cold harbour Lane, Brixton, within a month nearly all had secured accommodation and employment.  Taking up positions in a range of environments including the NHS and transport services, the new arrivals found work in essential industries that were key to post-war regeneration.\r\n<br></br>\r\nOutwardly, the Colonial Office congratulated themselves for a job well done. However, as had been the case since the imminence of the ship’s arrival, internal conversations were less encouraging.\r\nAfter learning of the Windrush’s imminent arrival, many alarmed MPs expressed their concern to Prime Minister Atlee, stating:\r\n“The British people fortunately enjoy a profound unity without uniformity in their way of life, and we are blest by the absence of a colour racial problem. <mark>An influx of coloured people domiciled here is likely to impair the harmony, strength and cohesion of our public and social life.</mark>”\r\n<br></br>\r\nHowever, after the war, in a bid to move away from a pre-war ‘imperial dominance’, Britain was eager to demonstrate its commitment to the creation of a fairer society. As part of such commitment, the Labour government desired to forge a new, more familial relationship with Commonwealth countries.  It was amidst this collaborative spirit that the 1948 Nationality Act and Commonwealth recruitment drives emerged.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/New-Arrivals.jpg\" alt=\"New Arrivals\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The new arrivals were interviewed by the Ministry of Labour and National Service Office to help them find work. <i>Source: Mirror.co.uk // Topfoto</i></q></sub>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nUnfortunately, the unwelcoming attitude expressed by certain MPs was also manifest in numerous British newspapers. News of the hostility reached the Caribbean, prompting concern over the potentially negative treatment was awaiting migrants. In response the Atlee government was keen to publicly alleviate any unease.  As historian Kenneth Lunn notes, any indication of restrictions or attitudes “which smacked of a ‘colour bar’”, risked provoking charges of racism that the government wished to avoid.\r\n<br></br>\r\nWhilst the British government was anxious to avoid appearing unwelcoming, at the same time a governmental feeling existed within Whitehall that a precedent should not be set. Many MPs wished to avoid providing too warm a welcome. <mark>They did not want to run the risk of encouraging others to follow suit and turning the country into what was described as “an open reception centre for immigrants”</mark>.  A further governmental concern was that the migrants be dispersed across the country as soon as possible.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/New-arrivals-2.jpg\" alt=\"New Arrivals\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Underground bunk beds with Windrush passengers. <i>Source: BBC.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nThe logic being that if the new arrivals were scattered widely enough, their presence would be less likely to attract negative attention, such as had already been seen in port communities such as Liverpool which was home to an existing black community.  As the Windrush approached, tensions arose between the Colonial Office, the Home Office and the Ministry of Labour - each department was keen to avoid assuming responsibility for facilitating the newcomers’ imminent arrival.  On the outside an apparent open door policy prevailed. <mark>Behind closed doors tensions about the implications of the new arrivals were bubbling</mark>.\r\n<br></br>\r\nYet, no formal policy in relation to West Indian immigration was formulated. Despite a recorded deterioration in race relations during the immediate post war years, and an awareness of hostile public attitudes towards black settlement, the government failed to enact legislation against racial discrimination.  Concerns over the treatment of the West Indian migrants were voiced. Yet, for various reasons, no solid action was taken to safeguard the reception and treatment of migrant communities.\r\n<br></br>\r\nWithin this period of ambivalence, although the official line was that the new arrivals had been settled and dispersed with apparent ease, <mark>in reality the country’s new inhabitants received a less than warm welcome.</mark> Many experienced extreme racism and intolerance from certain areas of society, denied access to certain employment opportunities and better housing on basis of their skin-colour. As a result of this discrimination, many of the West Indian migrants ended up settling in “the meanest housing” of inner city London in areas such as Brixton and Notting Hill where they faced “slum landlords, high rents and overcrowding”.  Making the line the official governmental line of ‘success’ difficult to understand.\r\n<br></br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Long-term Impact</b></h2>\r\n <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe way post-war governmental approaches to immigration have shaped the longer-term experiences of the Windrush community. In light of the 2018 <mark>‘Windrush Scandal’</mark> and the wrongful deportation of a number of individuals, it is evident that the after-shocks of the poor treatement of the Windrush generation experienced in the years proceeding 1948 is still being felt today.\r\nFollowing the 1948 Nationality Act, those arriving from Commonwealth countries were legally British subjects, however for many who came to Britain between 1948 and 1971, the experience has not always reflected this. As British citizens, those arriving with the Windrush generation were not immigrants, but migrants. Yet following their arrival, race became a marker used to strip these legal citizens of social acceptance.\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/We-are-not-illegal.jpg\" alt=\"We are Not Illegal\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The Windrush scandal is a 2018 British political scandal concerning people who were wrongly detained, denied legal rights, threatened with deportation, and, in around 63 cases, wrongly deported from the UK. Many of those affected are members of the Windrush generation. <i>Image: © Peter Marshall / Global Look Press.</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\nWhilst Britain had long been a multicultural country, the arrival of the Windrush signalled the advent of substantial and permanent black communities in Britain.  Headlines may have read ‘Welcome Home’, but in reality, beyond the initial arrival of the first new arrivals, there was a lack of governmental policy in place designed to maintain support and integration for those settling in Britain from Commonwealth nations.\r\n<br></br>\r\nDespite this, plans were in place to recruit from the Caribbean in order to satisfy the need for labour in key industries, such as London transport which was actively advertising vacancies in Barbados.  \r\n<br></br>\r\nBy 1958, there were around 125,000 Caribbean workers in Britain, with a disproportionate amount of these individuals represented in semi and unskilled roles. Due to the absence of official support, in addition to a concentration of black migrants in certain industries, migrants were left to secure housing through an “informal network of support”.  <mark>This led to a clustering of black migrants in certain urban areas, which made their presence seem greater and caused alarm to many of the local white population.</mark>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Racism</b></h2>\r\n <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nAs Caribbean migration grew, so too did the racist attitude of many white Britons towards the growing black communities. Claiming that the newcomers were taking jobs from capable White Britons, <mark>during the 1950s there was an increasingly hostile attitude towards black people.</mark> The growing concern over the ‘dangers of unrestricted immigration’ was reflected within the media, the tone of which had shifted from support of unrestricted migrant labour to one of suspicion. <mark>It was not uncommon for black citizens to face discrimination in a number of public environments including, hotels, shops, schools or housing.</mark>\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/KBW.jpg\" alt=\"Keep Britain White\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Young lady points to \'Keep Britain White\' graffiti at the International Personnel training centre in Balham.  <i>Source: Neil Kenlock // Tate</i></q></sub>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nFascist groups such as <mark>Oswald Mosley’s fascist Union Movement,</mark> <mark>Colin Jordan’s White Defense League</mark> and <mark>the League of Empire Loyalists</mark> added fuel to the fire. Yet there was still no recourse from the law to address the mounting racism within the country, which led to violent clashes during the 1958 Notting Hill Riots.\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Oswald-Mosley.jpg\" alt=\"Oswald Moseley\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists, at a rally in East London.<i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\nIn response to growing racial tension at the influx of new arrivals, <mark>in 1962, the Commonwealth Immigration Act was passed in order to curb the number of those travelling from Commonwealth countries into Britain.</mark>  The act introduced a system that required hopeful migrants to obtain government-issued work permits before they could enter.  But it was not until 1965 that policy directly addressing racial discrimination was made when the Race Relations Act came into effect making racial discrimination unlawful in public spaces.\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/1958 Notting Hill race riots.jpg\" alt=\"Notting Hill Race Riots\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The Notting Hill race riots were a series of racially motivated riots that took place in Notting Hill, England, between 29 August and 5 September 1958.<i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\nRelating to both British citizens and visitors, the law prohibited any form of discrimination based on a person’s colour, race or ethnic origins. Whilst there were those who resisted such reform, it was criticised for not going far enough. For example, it did not cover housing or employment where the issue was often most prevalent. This led to the passing of the Race Relations Act 1968 which sought to address areas such as housing, employment and advertising which were previously omitted.\r\n<br></br>\r\nIn 1971 the Immigration Act gave all Commonwealth Citizens already living in the UK indefinite leave to remain. In a further bid to control the number of people settling in the UK, the law also put an end to freedom of movement for Commonwealth citizens.  However, the Home Office never issued paperwork for those granted leave to remain to confirm their status, nor did they keep a record of those affected by the act.\r\n<br></br>\r\nFast forward a number of decades and the <b>‘Windrush Scandal’</b> appears to be a part of the wider continuum of black British experience. <mark>After being invited to Britain to provide vital support in the post-war reconstruction efforts, many British citizens have found themselves having their legal status questioned.</mark>  In addition to the absence of records created and issued during the 1970s, it has come to light that in 2010 the landing cards completed by incoming Commonwealth citizens, which were being stored by the Home Office, had been destroyed.  This lack of paperwork has led to serious problems for many of the Windrush generation. In 2012, strict changes to immigration law designed to target illegal immigration required that people provide the documentation confirming their right to work, rent or have access to healthcare.\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Hosstile-Environment.jpg alt=\"Hostile Environment\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The UK Home Office hostile environment policy is a set of administrative and legislative measures designed to make staying in the United Kingdom as difficult as possible for people without leave to remain, in the hope that they may \"voluntarily leave\".<i>Source: Wikipedia</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n<mark>Although legal citizens, many of the Windrush generation unable to produce the necessary paperwork have suddenly found their legal status questioned.</mark> The number of those affected remains unclear, as many of the Windrush generation travelled on parental passports and never applied for travel documents of their own. After being born or living in Britain for decades, a number of individuals have been wrongfully threatened with deportation to countries they may have not seen for 50 years.\r\n<br></br>\r\nFor some, the image of hundreds of Caribbean-born individuals filing off the ship’s gangplank in 1948 has become synonymous with “the beginning of modern British multicultural society”.  It is estimated that following the arrival of the Windrush and its passengers in 1948, by 1971 nearly half a million West Indian-born individuals left their homes to settle in Britain. This Caribbean diaspora has come to be known as the Windrush Generation.\r\n<br></br>\r\nWhen this piece of Black & British history has been given close attention, there has been a tendency to depict the arrival of the Windrush as a watershed moment in the history of black migration to Britain, prompting questions of race and the formation of the modern British identity.  It has been depicted as the ‘symbolic point of origin’ from which narratives surrounding British citizens of African descent should stem.\r\n<br></br>\r\n<mark>According to this perspective, 1948 is extoled as the opening chapter of the tumultuous road to becoming contemporary multicultural Britain.</mark> However, recent years have witnessed concerted efforts to re-think this narrative. As Barnor Hesse reminds us in his book \"Unsettled Multiculturalisms\", the portrayal of Black Britain as a post-war phenomenon is misleading, overlooking the individual stories of people of African descent who settled in Britain prior to 1948.  Furthermore, it suggests that racial tension within Britain is a relatively ‘recent’ issue resulting from the demographic upheaval of the post-war years, when in fact the problem of racism in Britain has a much longer history. To gain a deeper understanding of Britain’s migration history is to gain a better understanding of our current identity. Failure to do so is to perpetuate the historical amnesia that leads to the ignorance and prejudice that we must work to eradicate.\r\n<br></br>\r\n</p>', 'windrushgeneration.jpg', 1, NULL, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, 0, 1, 0, 0, 'London, United Kingdom', ''),

It was understood during the plague’s peak that these ships appeared to carry the plague but unclear as to how – the germ theory had not yet been formed. <mark>The best explanation of contagion during this period was known as “miasma”</mark>; the inhaling of toxic or infectious gases. The relative understanding of contagion led to the quarantining of certain ships for 40 days to ensure they were free from disease before coming to shore. The practice originated from medieval Venice, and comes from the Italian for “40 days”: quranta giorni.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Yersinia-Perstis.jpg\" alt=\"Plague Pits\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>A scanning electron micrograph depicting a mass of Yersinia pestis bacteria in the foregut of an infected flea.  <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<h2><i>How do we know about the early modern plague?</i></h2>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<h4>Bills of Mortality:</h4>\r\n\r\nThese are statistic reports produced to list numbers and causes of deaths in a specific area. Around plague pandemics similar publications known as the <mark>“Lord Have Mercy Upon Us”</mark> broadsheets were used specifically to communicate death tolls and other information on the plague around London. These publications demonstrate a rising culture of statistics around this period, possibly to install a sense of order around the rising panic. \r\n<br></br>\r\nThe Figure below tells us that <mark>3,880 people died from the plague</mark> between August 15th-22nd 1665 in this particular area of London. This accounts for a huge 73% of deaths in this specific week, giving us a rare statistic value of just how prevalent the disease was, and just how terrifying such a pandemic must have been in the absence of an effective treatment.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Bill-of-Mortality.jpg\" alt=\"Bill of Mortality\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The Diseases and Casualties this Week, Bill of Mortality, 1665. <i>Source: Welcome Collection / Accessed June 3rd 2018.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nAside from important information on the plague, the Bills of Mortality also give us an invaluable insight into contemporary disease culture. Some conditions are recognisable, such as “Consumption” or “Scurvy”, but some we can only guess at, such as “Rising of the Lights”. Indeed, one poor person is simply listed to have died “Suddenly”. Do we even know that every listed death by “Plague” is the plague as we know it? Unfortunately, the answer is most likely no. \r\n<br></br>\r\nCauses of death at this point were identified by “searchers” who did not have official medical training, but quickly checked corpses and passed the speculated cause of death on for the Bills of Mortality. Despite uncertainty over disease identification, the value of the publication as a source through which to view the plague or other diseases is not diminished. It gives us a chance to view these conditions as they existed and affected the population in 1665 rather than comparing them to modern equivalents, or even wonder if there is a modern equivalent. Just because we can identify the plague by its name in the early modern period does not mean it was experienced in the same way as it is today, and the unidentifiable conditions on the Bills of Mortality remind us of that. \r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<h4>Personal memoirs:</h4>\r\nAs much as Bills of Mortality tell us about how many people died of the plague, they tell us virtually nothing of personal experiences. Unfortunately, a primary source with this type of information is extremely hard to come by; if a person experienced plague it is unlikely that they would be concerned with writing it down. Indeed, although literacy rates appear to have steadily increased over this period, the majority of the population were if not completely illiterate, then only capable of reading. \r\n<br></br>\r\nThere are occasionally small glimpses of the disease within diaries kept at the time of the plague, but rarely at length. We see one of these in the writings of one of the most famous English diarists in history: Samuel Pepys.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Samuel.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Samuel Pepys was famous for the diary he kept for a decade while still a relatively young man. It provides a combination of personal revelation and eyewitness accounts of great events, such as the Great Plague of London. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nAlthough gaining fame for his account of the Great Fire of London, it is often forgotten that this event occurred around the same year as the final plague pandemic, 1665-66. Consequently, Pepys mentions his experiences with the plague but, as mentioned before, his lack of proximity is reflected in these experiences being limited to a line or two. On 14th September 1665 he wrote of one of these experiences: \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<mark><i>\"My meeting dead corpses of the plague, carried to be buried close to me at noonday through the City in Fanchurch Street. To see a person sick of the sores carried close by me by Gracechurch in a hackney-coach\"</i></mark>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nAlthough this seems to be a very limited excerpt, we can still learn several things from it. When looking specifically at plague pits, for example, the passage tells us that the dead were carried through Fanchurch Street (most likely modern-day Fenchurch Street, London, EC3M 4BS), meaning there may have been a burial pit nearby. As for contemporary symptoms, it tells us that the sores were possibly one of the most identifiable and diagnostic for the plague. The passage may be short, but is still an important piece of the puzzle. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<h4>Medical/Supernatural Treatises:</h4>\r\nThe prevalence of the plague in the 17th century led to many papers and reports being written on the disease by physicians, healers, supernaturalists and scientists alike (the distinctions between these different professions were much blurrier than they are today). These works were likely to be intended for circulation amongst the scholarly rather than for the general population; broadsheets tended to inform the literate masses, and ordinances from the monarch and reports from local councils were read out in public places for the rest. \r\n<br></br>\r\nAstrologer John Gadbury published his musings on causes of plagues in 1665. His explanations had a mainly supernatural basis, as can be seen by his focus on the alignments of the planets, and concerned various major plague outbreaks that had occurred in history.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<mark><i>\"In the year 1603, the Pestilence was inconsiderable in its increase, until the last week in June, and the month of July, at which times the fiery Planet Mars came to the opposite point of the Moon.\"</i></mark>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nGadbury’s discourse discusses the plague at length, and gives us some vague but usefully corroborative symptoms: \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<mark><i>\"Physicians tell us, that the Plague is a disease most Malignant and Pestilential ; a Fever in the highest in the highest degree, which doth putrifie and corrupt, both the Solid and Fluid parts of the body ; which have done, by an (almost) uncontrolable and unrepellable siccity, dries and destroys the Natural Powers, then seizeth or preyeth upon the vitals , and so lets in the everlasting Enemy, DEATH.\"</i></mark>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/John_Gadbury.jpg\" alt=\"Philosopher John Gadbury\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>Philosopher John Gadbury.<i>Source: Wikimedia Commons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nThis particular source may seem somewhat indistinct and spiritual when attempting to piece together various bits of information on the physical aspects of the plague in history, such as its symptoms and how different geographical locations were affected. It is, however, still an extremely useful source; this is partly for the same reasons as the usefulness of the Bills of Mortality. \r\n<br></br>\r\nMuch in the same way the Bills of Mortality show us that individual experiences of historical disease may be so different from our modern ones that we are unable to properly empathise them, Gadbury’s treatise presents a valid contemporary view of the physical aspects of the plague that we may potentially find difficult to use. \r\n<br></br>\r\nIt demonstrates the inherent interlinking of natural and supernatural causes within disease culture at the time, as shown with the constant undertone of sin and judgement. Moreover, the significance of religion is made similarly obvious through this sinful narrative. \r\n<br></br>\r\nThe notion that supernatural explanations may be vital in understanding natural aspects of the plague can help us uncover details that may otherwise have gone unexplained if the focus were solely on modern interpretation of physical elements of the disease. \r\n<br></br>\r\nThis includes tiny details such as the layout and spacing of victims in a plague pit; the regular, careful positioning of the victims indicate that proper burials were vital even in densely filled plague pits, most likely because of the constant presence of religion and tradition, and the role of the parish. \r\n<br></br>\r\n<h4>Official documents</h4>\r\nPlague pandemics tended to cause disorder, panic and subversions of social orders <mark>(given that no-one, not even those that were wealthier, were safe from the disease)</mark>. Ordinances issued by the monarch can be seen as attempts to dampen this chaos through information and guidelines. \r\n<br></br>\r\nCharles II published <mark>“Rules and Orders”</mark> on the prevention of the plague in 1665 to control the contagious nature of the disease. The document is specifically for the instruction of “Justices of Peace, Mayors, Bayliffs, and other Officers”, i.e. those in charge of lay people.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Rules-and-Orders.jpg\" alt=\"Charles II, \"Rules and Orders\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>Charles II, \"Rules and Orders.<i>Source: National Archives, Accessed June 12th 2018</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the document is not necessarily concerned with how an individual may protect him or herself from sickening, but how households, villages, etc, can protect themselves. \r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nIt is a practical document, meaning we can see what details were deemed to be important enough to pass on from the highest-level authority to his subjects. We can see various historical concepts covered in other sources, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\nMiasma (the belief that disease spread through bad-smelling air). Rules 6 & 7 dictate that “convenient Fumes to correct the Air be burnt” in public places, and that “no unwholsome Meats, stinking Fish, Flesh, musty Corn” may be sold.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\nSpecific symptoms that searchers should look out for. Rule no. 10 dictates that local areas should be prepared to identify and care for the sick and that searchers should identify the plague by the “usual… Swellings or Risings under the Ears or Arm-pits [buboes], or upon the Groynes; Blains, Carbuncles, or little Spots, either on the Breast or back, commonly called Tokens.”\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\nThe significance of religion and the supernatural. As mentioned with regard to John Gadbury’s astronomical treatise on the plague, cures and explanations that we may think of spiritual rather than medical were used readily and expected to protect as effectively as any physical treatment. Rule no. 12 dictates that on any affected household undergoing quarantine should “have a Red Cross, and Lord have mercy upon us, in Capital Letter affixed on the door”. That such a practical report would include such religious treatments against the plague again shows how these acts were as important at the time as those more medical, such as quarantine. The final line of the report asks that everyone take heed of these orders and maintain regular prayers and fasts in order to reverse God’s punishment.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br></br>\r\nThe report also gives us more information on the elusive plague pits. Rule no. 13 dictates where and how plague victims should be buried: \r\n<br></br>\r\n<mark><i>\"in some other convenient place [than church yards], and that a good quantity of unslaked Lime be put into Graves with such bodies, and that such Graves be not after opened within the space of a year or more, less they infect others.\"</i></mark>\r\n<br></br>\r\nAlso mentioned in the orders, that we have not seen in aforementioned primary sources, is the first glimpses of the welfare state. Given the belief that sin and punishment were the major causes of the plague pandemic, the orders ensure that “such visited poor may have sufficient Relief; want and nastiness being great occasions of the Infection.” \r\n<br></br>\r\nCoupled with the careful burials we see in plague pits, it can be ascertained that the plague may have fostered a culture of respect and care rather than one of isolation, which is often assumed from the fear of contagion. \r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<h4>Popular Literature</h4>\r\nOne of the most interestingly comprehensive overviews of the plague pandemic of 1665-6 comes from the author Daniel Defoe, in his novel entitled Journal of the Plague Year. The novel follows the main character, simply referred to as H. F., during the pandemic in London. \r\n<br></br>\r\nWhen compared to other primary sources used to understand the plague, Journal of the Plague Year certainly seems to corroborate. Defoe writes on the physical symptoms:\r\n<br></br>\r\n<mark><i>\"The swellings, which were generally in the neck or groin, when they grew hard and would not break, grew so painful that it was equal to the most exquisite torture; and some, not able to bear the torment, threw themselves out at windows”… “or otherwise made themselves away, and I saw several objects of that kind.\"</i></mark>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Plague-Victims.jpg\" alt=\"Plague Victims\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>Plague Victims.<i>Source: Wikimedia</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nWe can liken this description of buboes to those given in other non-fiction sources, e.g., Charles II’s “Rules and Orders” and John Gadbury’s London’s deliverance predicted, being relatively detailed and graphic. This, however, also plays into the literary techniques of the novel, hence why it may be a slight exaggeration. To ‘make oneself away’ during this period, for example, literally meant to kill oneself. \r\n<br></br>\r\nSuicide was seen as a religious crime against God – self-murder – and so whether this would have regularly occurred in a population readily believed to be being punished for their sins with the plague anyway, is debatable. It is due to these images of Defoe’s imagination within the text that it is unclear where it lies on the fiction/non-fiction spectrum. \r\n<br></br>\r\nDespite Defoe’s guiding hand, the work is often read as non-fiction and used for various details on the physical aspects of the plague; online history guide Historic UK has used it as one of their sources to map the locations of various plague pits. Indeed, Journal of the Plague Year references death tolls, burial registers and plague pits that, to a certain extent, do seem to be grounded in reality, as with his dimensions of the Aldgate plague pit. \r\n<br></br>\r\nRegardless of whether we can cross-reference every detail given by Defoe on the plague, it provides an interesting contemporary popular view of how the disease was experienced. In other words, because the novel was written within living memory of plague year, Defoe would have had little reason to exaggerate or change objective details such as plague pit dimensions; these could easily have been checked. We can assume they are relatively accurate, and hence use it as the last important piece of the puzzle in the understanding of the early modern plague.\r\n<br></br>', 'pzk.jpg', 1, NULL, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, 0, 1, 0, 0, '', ''),

While Winston Churchill boldly proclaimed that Britain’s bombers would provide the means of victory in 1940 – a quote that can be found on the inside western wall of the memorial – they have ultimately been minimalised and airbrushed out of British memory due to the murky nature of their mission.\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Fotothek_df_ps_0000010_Blick_vom_Rathausturm.jpg\" alt=\"Bombing Dresdan\" height=\"auto\" width=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Dresden, 1945, view from the city hall (Rathaus) over the destroyed city. <i>Source: Deutsche Fotothek / Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps for this reason that along the monuments northern side is an engraving that alludes to this difficult subject; “this memorial also commemorates those of all nations who lost their lives in the bombings of 1939-1945.” It is no accident that that the seven bronze men have been immortalised in sombre contemplation, as each of the seven men walk away from their mission it seems they are reflecting on the impossibly difficult act they have undertaken in the name of peace - humanising them once again.

Originally built as a defensive structure, the city wall was constructed by the Romans to protect the strategically important town of Londinium from the Picts. Much of the wall was dismantled during the 1700s, however hardy sections can still be glimpsed, standing proudly as bastions of London’s ancient past.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUnbeknownst to many, a substantial portion of the wall remains within the courtyard of The Grange City Hotel on Cooper’s Row.

This site proves both a historic and modern appreciation for the work on public health by Dr John Snow, making it an important piece of London’s medical and social history. Snow was credited with advancing epidemiology (the study of the spread of disease) and moving past outdated theories of contagion. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/John_Snow_memorial_and_pub.jpg\" alt=\"Dr John Snow\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Outside the pub on the corner was the pump which infected so many in the area with cholera and which led Snow to determine the reasons for cholera\'s spread.<i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nThe pub itself stands on Broadwick Street, previously known as Broad Street, around which Snow famously surveyed an outbreak of cholera in 1854.

A commemorative plaque and water pump similar to those on Broadwick Street mark his origins in North Street, York, over 200 miles north of The John Snow in the capital. At the age of fourteen Snow worked as a medical apprentice in Newcastle, England, and witnessed the Newcastle cholera epidemic of 1831-32. Whether this peaked his interest in the prevalent and deadly disease is unclear, but nevertheless Snow went on to train as a physician in the years following. \r\n<br></br>\r\nHis prowess within medicine is evident from his various memberships of colleges and societies: the Royal College of Surgeons; the Westminster Medical Society (later the Medical Society of London); and a founding member of the London Epidemiological Society. During his life he published his findings in several papers, both on his epidemiological studies and pioneering experimentation on medical anaesthetic. \r\n<br></br>\r\nSnow’s curiosity of health and disease also infiltrated his personal life; he was a vegetarian, teetotaler, and purified his water through distillation. These quirks supposedly aided his health and he campaigned for them to be recognised, going as far as to refer to alcohol as a “physical evil” in an address given in 1836. Despite his health-conscious lifestyle, Snow died an early death aged only 45. The cause of death is speculated over; suggestions range from a stroke, to over-exposure to experimental chemicals, and even his extreme health-habits. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<h2>Cholera and the Broad St. Pump</h2>\r\n\r\nCholera in the 1800s was rife due to poor sanitation and a lack of knowledge as to how exactly it could be contracted. Pandemics hit England and Scotland several times throughout the century and caused widespread panic due to the fast-acting nature of the disease. The main symptoms of cholera are vomiting and diarrhea, leading quickly to dehydration and potentially death when untreated. Anxiety over contagion lead to a Board of Health releasing local reports on supposed disease prevention. \r\n<br></br>\r\n<mark>The leading theory on how cholera spread was known as “miasma”, meaning “pollution” or bad air.</mark> It was thought that diseases could be spread by foul-smelling, toxic gases - a logical theory as disease appeared to spread faster around open sewage, rotten meat, rats, and generally poor conditions. The germ theory at this point had yet to be discovered, meaning advice tended towards moving away from the pollution.\r\n<br></br>\r\nJohn Snow published his contrary speculations on how cholera seemed to spread in his 1849 pamphlet entitled “On the Mode of Communication of Cholera”. He put forward that miasmic theory did not sufficiently explain the spreading pattern and time of symptoms known with cholera, meaning that the disease may not be spread by bad smells or inhalation of contaminated air.\r\n<br></br>\r\nHe posed that perhaps open sewers coming into contact with drinking water was to blame. After several case studies of parishes around the Thames, and also cities further afield, Snow published a more comprehensive text on his new theory. \r\n<br></br>\r\nInterestingly, of the several case studies looked at by Snow, the outbreak on Broad St. was one that did not originally fit his hypothesis. He tested the drinking water of the area and found it to be relatively pure, meaning he “hesitated to come to a conclusion”. After retesting, however, he found that the impurity of the water fluctuated from high to low, meaning his theory of water contamination causing the outbreak may have still been possible. \r\n<br></br>\r\nAfter acquiring a list of deaths from the Soho General Register Office Snow plotted the number of deaths caused by cholera in the area on a map, and found them to be concentrated around a water pump on Broad Street (only 10 of 83 deaths that he counted at this point occurred in houses closer to a different street pump than Broad Street - half of these cases informed Snow they drank from the Broad Street pump anyway, another 3 were likely to have attended a school near the pump). \r\n<br></br>\r\n<h6>Snow describes the famous conclusion and consequence:</h6>\r\n<i>The result of the inquiry was then was, that there had been no particular outbreak or increase in cholera, in this part of London, except among the persons that were in the habit of drinking the water of the above-mentioned pump well.I had an interview with the Board of Guardians of St. James’s parish, on the evening of Thursday, 7th September, and presented the above circumstances to them. In consequence of what I said, the handle of the pump was removed the following day. </i>\r\n<br></br>\r\nJohn Snow’s focus on practical prevention of cholera, rather than fruitlessly studying the disease itself, slowly ushered in a new era of public health. His understanding of water contamination as opposed to miasmic theory was slow to be accepted as it was a huge shift in thinking and had huge repercussions on everyday life (in the location of cesspits, for example). It would not be until Robert Koch discovered the bacterium responsible for cholera almost three decades later that Snow’s research was more readily accepted. \r\n\r\n<h2>Anaesthesia</h2>\r\nAlongside his research into the spread of cholera, John Snow is also credited with bringing medical anaesthesia into fashion. Having experimented using both ether and chloroform on animals, Snow studied the benefits and potential risks of both. He built on various designs of other scientists to perfect an “anaesthetic inhaler”, where the patient could simply breath in without worrying about correct concentrations and dosages. \r\n<br></br>\r\nIn 1853 Snow administered chloroform to Queen Victoria during the birth of her eighth child, Leopold. Due to reservations over the new anaesthetic inhaler Snow used the “open-drop method”; where material would be placed over the patient’s nose and mouth and chloroform dropped on the surface so the patient can inhale the vapour. Snow’s casenotes describe the Queen after the birth to have been “very cheerful and well, expressing herself much gratified with the effect of the chloroform.” \r\n<br></br>\r\nHesitancies over numbing the pain of childbirth existed prior to this event due to biblical emphasis on the ‘curse of Eve’: having given into temptation in the Garden of Eden Eve would be cursed to have pain in childbirth. Some believed that the easing of this pain was deliberately going against the word of God, however Queen Victoria’s example paved the way for further use of medical anaesthesia in other types of surgery and dentistry as well as obstetrics.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'john_snow.jpg', 1, 1, 0, 0, '-0.1387813', '51.5132742', 1, 1, 0, 0, '', ''),

On refusal to pay the fine imposed by the court, they went to prison and this generated publicity for the cause. \r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Annie_Kenney_and_Christabel_Pankhurst.jpg\" alt=\"Annie and Christabel Pankhurst.jpg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>Annie Kenney and Christabel Pankhurst were dedicated suffragettes who paved the way for others.

Instead, the WSPU proudly adopted the name, saying \"suffraGETtes\" (stressing the GET while they pronounced the term), to imply that they were adamant to achieve their goals. From 1909, the sale of the \"Pank-A-Squith\" (Pankhurst and Asquith) board game was used to raise money and gain publicity for the cause. The board game’s principle strategy required players to lead their suffragette figure from their home to Parliament, past the obstacles faced from Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, and the Liberal government.\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/banners.jpg\" alt=\"WSPU\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>WSPU Members making banners<i>Source: LSE Library / Available on Flickr</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nIt may be surprising to discover that the suffrage campaign was not simply a feminine movement, meaning that principles were not only fought for by women. <mark>Many men were committed to the cause, and actively participated in the campaign.</mark> Notable examples include Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, George Lansbury MP, and Keir Hardie MP who regularly raised the issue of women enfranchisement in the House of Commons. \r\n<br></br>\r\nIn 1906, James Keir Hardie introduced Frederick and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence to Emmeline Pankhurst.<mark> An apartment in Clement’s Inn, between Lincoln’s Inn Fields and Aldwych was home to them both, and it became the headquarters of the fledgling Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU)</mark>. With the organisation only admitting female members, Frederick was not an official member. As a barrister, he represented WSPU in legal matters and stood bail for more than one-hundred members.\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/1.jpg\" alt=\"Clement Inn\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>Mrs Emmeline Pankhurst and Mrs Mabel Tuke photographed in Mrs Pankhurst\'s office in Clements Inn.<i>Source: LSE Library / Available on Flickr</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Frederick and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence</h4>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe couple contributed to the proper structure and organisation of WSPU, with Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence being credited as the originator of the WSPU campaign colours, purple, white and green; she memorably described as ‘purple for dignity, white for purity and green for hope’ in 1908. They were also committed in giving WSPU sizeable financial contributions. In 1907, Frederick founded the WSPU periodical, ‘Votes for Women’ with Emmeline and himself as joint editors. This periodical, which sold over 20,000 copies each week, helped recruit WSPU members and win public support for the cause. \r\n<br></br>\r\nIn 1912, large-scale smashing of shop windows along Oxford Street, led to the arrest of the couple even though they had nothing to do with the event. They were made culpable for the event and sentenced to nine-months’ imprisonment. Sued for the cost of the damage, they went in to a period of bankruptcy. With Emmeline in Holloway Prison, and Frederick in Brixton Prison, both were force-fed, and subjected to ill-treatment. \r\n<br></br>\r\n<mark>In October 1912, Emmeline and Frederick were expelled from the WSPU for they were no longer in agreement with the extreme militant tactics.</mark> Despite the split, they were still loyal and committed to the cause. Both continued to edit and publish ‘Votes for Women’ and their Clement’s Inn home in London which served as office for WSPU continued to serve as a recuperating clinic for suffragettes who had just been released from the prison.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Pethick-couple.jpg\" alt=\"The Couple\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>Frederick Pethick Lawrence (far left) and His wife, Emmeline (far right). <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sophia - The Suffragette Princess</h2>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nBorn in Belgravia in 1876, Princess Sophia Duleep Singh, the daughter of an exiled Punjabi Maharaja and the treasured goddaughter of Queen Victoria, was a prominent woman of colour and a pivotal figure in the women’s suffrage movement. It was not until she and her sisters sneaked into India in 1903, to see the celebration of the accession of King Edward VII, that she changed from a vacuous socialite to a political activist. \r\n<br></br>\r\nOn her visit to India, she came face to face with all that her family had lost, saw abject poverty and experienced racism at first hand. She attributed these factors to the severity of the British colonial rule. <mark>In 1909, Singh came back to England with an awakened sense of dispossession, and discovered the appeal for votes for women irresistible, and so she soon joined the Women’s Social and Political Union.</mark>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Sophia-and-Her-Sisters.jpg\" alt=\"Sophia\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>The last of the empire: Daughters of Maharajah Duleep Singh; Bamba, Catherine and Sophia — photographed in 1892. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nAs a suffragette, Singh donated and raised vast amounts of money for the organisation, including when violence and arson attacks were prominent. Singh vandalised her census paper, defied court judgments awarded against her, and as a member of the Women’s Tax Resistance league, refused to pay her taxes. Living in Hampton Court in an apartment in Faraday House, given to her by Queen Victoria, she sold the suffragette’s newspaper ‘The Vote’ outside Hampton Court. \r\n<br></br>\r\nOn one occasion, she threw herself at Prime Minister Asquith’s car, slamming a ‘Votes for Women’ pamphlet against his window but was released without charge. Despite Singh\'s activism as a suffragette, <mark>she was never arrested as she was a royal and her arrest would have attracted maximum attention to an ‘unwanted’ political cause</mark>. Singh marched next to Emmeline on 18 November 1910, an event that would become known as the Black Friday.\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Sophia-selling-paperss.jpg\" alt=\"Sophia\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>Princess Sophia Duleep Singh selling subscriptions for the Suffragette newspaper outside Hampton Court in London, April 1913. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Suffragettes, Violence and Militancy</h2>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nMembers of the Suffragettes were prepared to use violence to reach their designed goal of women’s political freedoms. Their militant tactics involved the interruption of anti-suffrage ministers, arson attacks on post box contents and empty public places, and window smashing. <mark>To protest the Church of England, who were not in support of women’s voting rights, the WSPU were known to place bombs inside Westminster Abbey, St. Paul’s Cathedral and other Anglican churches.</mark> \r\n<br></br>\r\nGolf courses, cricket pitches, horse racing tracks and places where the affluent frequented were also destroyed when unattended. On 19 February 1913, one of the two bombs which was targeted at Pinfold Manor in Surrey, which was being built for Chancellor of the exchequer, David Lloyd-George, exploded, causing significant damage. Further targets included train stations, houses of anti-suffrage ministers, and libraries.\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/sufragettes-arson-attacks.jpg\" alt=\"Destruction\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>Police survey Saunderton Railway Station after a suffragette arson attack, March 9th, 1913. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Black Friday</h2>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nIn 1908, owing to the absence of Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, 500,000 activists rallied through Hyde Park in London and proceeded towards Downing Street. <mark>Suffragettes continued to damage property in Downing Street and further chained themselves to railings at the Prime Minister’s residence to gain the Prime Minister’s attention.</mark> On 18 November 1910, despite making it to the second reading, Prime Minister Herbert Asquith decided not to proceed with the Conciliation Bill, which would have provided women with the ability to vote. This response was met with a protest from suffragettes, who viciously protested outside Parliament. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/march.jpg\" alt=\"Destruction\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>In 1908, owing to the absence of Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, 500,000 activists rallied through Hyde Park in London and proceeded towards Downing Street. <i>Source: BBC</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nDue to the involvement of police and male vigilantes, the protest resulted in failure. Many women became injured and some protesters lost their lives for the cause. Many male and female protesters were also arrested during the rally. Marked as the <mark>‘Black Friday of British women’s suffrage campaign’,</mark> the rally on 18 November 1910 gained publicity and sympathetic support for the WSPU, and increased support from newspapers through pictures of unarmed women being assaulted.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/The Daily Mirror.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Mirror\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>The front page of The Daily Mirror, 19 November 1910, showing a suffragette on the ground, having been hit by a policeman. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n<p>\r\n<h2>Boycotting the Census</h2>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nOn the 2nd April 1911, the Suffragette organisation urged women to boycott the census, which was controlled by the Liberal government. With the rallying call of, <mark>“If women don’t count, neither shall they be counted”,</mark> the censuses boycott emerged from the Women’s Freedom League campaign for non-violent ‘passive resistance’ against the government. This saw many women deface their census schedule, or spend the night away from home to avoid being counted. Women kept moving from place to place, hid, or gathered at the home of a census resister. One house in Manchester resulted in it being renamed “census lodge”, as it housed many census evaders. \r\n<br></br>\r\nIn London, some gathered for a midnight picnic of roast fowl, sweetmeats and tea at Wimbledon Common. Others spent the night walking, talking and singing at Trafalgar Square. A vegetarian restaurant in Covent Garden stayed open to provide refreshments. In many parts of the nation – namely Cardiff, Bristol, Liverpool, Ipswich, Cheltenham, Reading and Maidstone – <mark>suffragettes hosted overnight events with the sole purpose of boycotting the census.</mark> \r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Census.jpg\" alt=\"Boycotting the Census\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>Suffragettes gathered in Manchester Census Lodge to Boycott the 1911 Census. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nMany women vandalised the census by defacing their forms or by completing them with inappropriate answers. One notable example includes Mary Howey of Hertfordshire, who inscribed a large “votes for women” on her form, and listed her occupation as “artist and suffragette”. Another example includes Miss Davies, a suffragette from Birkenhead who wrote on her form the name of a male servant, and added that there were no other persons present within the home. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/census-slip.jpg\" alt=\"Boycotting the Census\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>The Census form has been returned blank and in place of household details, a large \'Votes for Women\' flyer has been stuck. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nThe same night, Emily Wilding Davison, who would tragically lose her life two years later, hid in a broom cupboard in the Houses of Parliament for 46 hours. Though caught and arrested she was released without charge. Boycotting the census showed a lot of courage as protesters expected a fine of £5 or a month’s imprisonment. However, no person was prosecuted, theoretically due to the large-scale number of suffragettes involved, and due to the criticism, that would have occurred if this was the case.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nNevertheless, public outrage towards the suffragettes was present. A letter to The Times labelled the boycott as a \"crime against science\", while the political magazine Punch joked: \"the suffragettes have definitely taken leave of their census\". Despite many women boycotting the census, their efforts were negligible in nullifying the census as many were counted while on the streets and some households listed the name of their missing occupants. Nevertheless, whilst it did not nullify the census results it gave public attention to the injustices of the British voting system, the suffragette movement and its campaign for ‘Votes for Women’. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Force Feeding the suffragettes</h2>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nBetween 1905 and 1914, around 1000 suffragettes had been arrested and given prison sentences of anywhere from 3 days to several months. However, suffragettes were willing to go to prison, and some used hunger strikes as a powerful tool to protest their arrest and to demand the status of political suffragettes in custody. <mark>The Government’s response to hunger strikes were to force-feed those who participated, this involved individuals being strapped down and a tube unpleasantly forced down the throat or nostril to ensure that food could be pumped into the stomach.</mark>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/forcefeeding.jpg\" alt=\"Boycotting the Census\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>Forceful Feeding through the nose of women suffragists prisoners pronounced as dangerous by many leading members of the medical profession. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nForce feeding suffragettes not only caused a public outcry, as forced feeding was traditionally used to feed criminal inmates, but the demeaning and dangerously invasive procedure damaged the long-term health of victims. For example, Lady Constance Lytton, who disguised herself as a ‘Jane Warton’ to gather evidence on differential treatment, was force-fed several times and never fully recovered from her ordeal. Lytton suffered a stroke in 1912 and died in 1923. This ultimately gained publicity for the women’s suffrage campaign.\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<h2>The Cat and Mouse Act</h2>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nIn 1913, with the motive of preventing suffragettes from dying as martyrs in police custody, the government introduced the Prisoners Temporary Discharge for Ill Health Act, commonly known as the ‘Cat and Mouse Act’. <mark>It was designed to provide for the release of suffragettes whose hunger strikes and forced feeding had brought them illness, as well as their arrest and re-imprisonment as soon as they had regained strength.</mark>\r\n<br></br>\r\nIn response to the ‘Cat and Mouse Act’, Edith Garrud, who was one of the western world’s first female martial arts teachers, taught self-defence classes that protected women from being rearrested and sent back to jail. Garrud was known to protect prominent members, such as Emmeline Pankhurst. Members of Garrud’s classes orchestrated the \"escapes\" of several suffragettes from police surveillance during 1913 and early 1914. The \"Battle of Glasgow\" was one of the notable events in which suffragettes were violent with the police. This saw about thirty suffragettes clash with an estimated fifty police officers on the stage of St. Andrew\'s Hall in Glasgow, Scotland.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Cat-and-Mouse-Act.jpg\" alt=\"Boycotting the Census\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>The Cat and Mouse Act gained notoriety amongst women\'s suffrage organisations in the UK in the early 1910s. <i>Source: Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<h2>Emily Wilding Davidson: The \"Suffragette\" Derby</h2>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nOn 4th June 1913, the London born Emily Wilding Davidson, who had been arrested nine times and force-fed forty-nine times, decided to disrupt the Epsom Derby to draw attention to the women’s suffrage campaign. <mark>Davidson famously stepped out in front of Anmer, a horse owned by King George which resulted in her being knocked down.</mark> She died after four days due to a fractured skull and internal injuries. Owing to reports, it was not clear if she intended to kill herself for the cause. \r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Emily.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Davidson\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>In 1906, Emily Davison joined Emmeline Pankhurst\'s \"Women\'s Social Political Union (WSPU).

Her death was iconic to the women’s suffrage campaign and she became a martyr to the cause. Thousands of women attended her funeral and lined the streets as her coffin was moved to its final resting place. She was laid to rest at Morpeth, Northumberland, and her grave was inscribed with the suffragette’s “Deeds Not Words” slogan.\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/derby.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Davidson\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>On June 4, Emily Wilding Davison stepped onto the track at the Epsom Derby and collided with King George V’s horse, Anmer.

As a result, the Government released the suffragette prisoners, and Emmeline Pankhurst convinced her fellow suffragettes to suspend their militant activities and actively support the government in war efforts as a united nation. <mark>Around one-million women took up men’s work while they fought in the Great War.</mark>\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/World-War-5.jpg\" alt=\"World War\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>Emmeline Pankhurst convinced her fellow suffragettes to suspend their militant activities and actively support the government in war efforts as a united nation. <i> Image: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nWhether it was due to the sympathy, the support the suffrage got from the public or women’s vital contribution during the war, one thing was certain; a new reform had to be passed to modernise political standings and include women in the nation’s vital political decisions. Many of the returning soldiers were no longer entitled to vote, as they did not meet existing property qualifications.\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/World-war.jpg\" alt=\"World War\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>A female munitions worker in a British factory during World War One, which was one of the catalysts for women finally getting the vote.  <i> Image: Tom Marshall/mediadrumworld.com</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\nThe need for the enfranchisement of women was also finally recognised by most members of parliament from all three major parties. Therefore, on 6th February 1918, the Representation of the People Act was passed. This extended suffrage to men over the age of twenty-one (removing most property qualifications), British women over the age of 30 that were property owners, members of the local government register, and university graduates. \r\n<br></br>\r\n<h2>...and Finally</h2>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nOn 21st November 1918, the Parliament (Qualification of Women Act) 1918 was passed. This allowed women to be elected to Parliament. The main reason for the age differential was to ensure that, following the loss of men in the war, women did not become the majority voters. Even though just over eight million women met this criterion, it only represented forty-percent of the total population of women in the nation. Furthermore, in 1928, the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act granted all women over the age of twenty-one voting rights. <mark>This was the first time that women had achieved electoral equality with men.</mark>\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/woman.jpg\" alt=\"Freedom\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"><sub><q>Finally in 1918, Parliament passed an act granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who were householders, the wives of householders, occupiers of property and graduates of British universities.

The Water-Lily Pond (1899) By Claude-Oscar Monet </h4> <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/the-national-gallery-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"The National Gallery\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>The Water-Lily Pond <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the World’s most famous Impressionist artists, of course, Monet had to make an appearance amongst the must-see paintings at the National Gallery. Born in 1840 in Paris, France, Monet was a founder of French impressionist painting and practitioner of the movements philosophy of expressing one’s individual perception of nature- hence the unique and iconic style of painting which we all recognise in Monet’s work today. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs a result of this, Monet was heavily inspired by nature and created a variety of stunning pieces influenced by the beauty of his home in Giverny, The Water-Lily Pond which is currently on display at the National Gallery is in fact, one of those paintings. At the end of his life, Monet found the subject matter for his art in the gardens of his home, specifically, the water-lily pond and the beautiful Japanese Bridge he constructed across it. This piece is one of seventeen other paintings which Monet began to paint in 1899, which feature the beautiful pond and bridge. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2. Sunflowers (1888) By Vincent Van Gogh:</h4> <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/the-national-gallery-image3-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"The National Gallery\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Sunflowers (1888) By Vincent Van Gogh <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSticking with the impressionist theme, is this beautiful iconic painting by Vincent Van Gogh, a Dutch post-impressionist painter, who is one of he most famous and influential figures in the history of Western Art. Creating about 2,100 pieces of art in just ten years, Van Gogh’s paintings are characterised by their bold colours, expressive brush-strokes, and a tragic and complex personal history behind them. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBorn in 1853 in Zundert, Netherlands, Van Gogh had a history of Mental Illness and following a lack of commercial success when he was alive, he lived a life of poverty and subsequently committed suicide in 1890 aged just thirty-seven. Van Gogh painted Sunflowers in 1888, and the painting is primarily yellow- which he associated with hope and friendship.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nHe suggested that his four Sunflowers canvases express an ‘idea symbolising gratitude’, and was thought to have been pleased with the outcome, as he hung the painting in the guest bedroom of his home in Arles in anticipation of the arrival of his friend, Paul Gauguin (A French post-impressionistic artist)  \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h4>3. The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) By Jan Van Eyck </h4><p class=\"text-justify\"> \r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/the-national-gallery-image4-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"The National Gallery\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) By Jan Van Eyck <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPainted in 1434 by EARLY Netherlandish painter Jan Van Eyck, The Arnolfini Portrait is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art due to its beauty, iconography and picture space-with Eycks complex use of the mirror. Painted on an oak panel using oil paints, this portrait depicts Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife to record their wedding. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nArnolfini was a member of an Italian merchant family from Lucca, who was living in Bruges- the interior is well-appointed suggesting an element of wealth. A fun-fact about the painting is if you look closely, just above the mirror, there are words written in Latin, which basically translates to ‘Jan van Eyck was here, 1434’. This quirky feature is not accidental as Van Eyck would often inscribe his pictures in a witty way.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h4>Food and Drink facilities:</h4> <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nYes, there are food and drink facilities at the National Gallery. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe National Dining Rooms offer stunning views across Trafalgar Square and the Menu offers the best in British Produce. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe National Café offers all day dining, with a self-service Café. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThere is also an Espresso Bar which offers visitors a range of hot-drinks and cakes. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<h4>Tours:</h4> <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nA free daily guided tour is available daily from 2-3pm, which gives visitors a 60-minute taster tour of the collection.

Despite this, the IRA of the middle part of the century remained relatively small up until the end of the 1960s.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe creation of Northern Ireland had not been a clean and simple affair, by the 1960s, the situation within the new nation was still fraught. On one side of the divide there were the Unionists, a predominantly Protestant group that believed the nation was best served by remaining within the United Kingdom. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/the-creation-of-northern-ireland.jpg\" alt=\"The Troubles\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The creation of Northern Ireland had not been a clean and simple affair. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nOpposing them were the Catholic Republicans, a group of people who felt marginalised within society at that time and subsequently saw Northern Ireland’s future as being intrinsically linked with the Republic of Ireland, and not with the UK. Against the backdrop of this struggle, a wave of violence between the two groups gradually transformed into open conflict in 1968. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy the August of 1969 the violence between the two groups became so disruptive that the British government felt the need to intervene through the deployment of troops under Operation Banner.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe army was expected to be a neutral player in the Troubles, one that would keep the peace and show no bias to either of the two viewpoints. For a brief period of time that appeared to be the case, however the heavy-handed way in which British troops dealt with civil unrest prompted many Catholics to view the troops as a foreign force to be feared and actually encouraged an escalation in hostilities in response. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<!-- Copy & Pasted from YouTube -->\r\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gRVzMgzQZw0?start=436\" frameborder=\"1\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>So Who were the IRA? </h1>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe rapidly deteriorating situation in Northern Ireland in the 1960s subsequently led to a split in the ranks of the group that resulted in the formation of the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1969. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn testament to both the longevity of the driving philosophy of the IRA of 1916, and the continued presence of hardship in Northern Ireland, this new group once again sought the creation of a single united self-ruling Ireland. The old IRA would also continue to exist, albeit in a diminished manner under the guise of the ‘official IRA’.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven though both groups held similar motivations and were equally prone to the use of violence, the PIRA pushed both of these elements so much further that they would become infamous on both sides of the Irish Sea. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/who-are-the-ira-irish-republican-army.jpg\" alt=\"The Troubles\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The IRA began as an alternative name for the Irish Volunteers, the official army of the emergent Irish state and its new parliament which in 1919 declared Ireland a free republic in defiance of Britain. <i>Source: The Irish Times</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PIRA fully embraced their paramilitary roots and held true to the distinction that they were an army, so much of their identity was enshrined within that one word that it would subsequently fuel and justify their mission for over thirty years. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeán Mac Stiofain, one of the groups co-founders who served as the PIRA’s chief of staff till 1972 once boldly declared, <mark>‘you’ve got to have military victory first and then politicize the people afterwards.’</mark>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom this it becomes clear that the PIRA were fully prepared to dogmatically use whatever military force it could muster in order see the full withdrawal of the United Kingdom from Northern Ireland. They viewed themselves as being at war and were as a result ready to act in a manner that befitted their outlook. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Provisional-ira-members-recieving-training.jpg\" alt=\"The Troubles\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) is a radical terrorist group formed in 1969 as clandestine armed wing of Sinn Fein, a legal political movement dedicated to removing British forces from Northern Ireland and unifying Ireland. <i>Source: Flickr / Provisional Irish Republican Army</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<h1> Bloody Sunday </h1>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nTo achieve their goal of a free and united Ireland, the PIRA first set out to become a major military force within Northern Ireland itself. Engagements with the British Army, Unionist Paramilitaries, and even occasionally the Official IRA became a routine occurrence. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInitially the group avoided conducting attacks and operations based outside of their Northern Irish heartlands. However, the events of the 30th of January 1972, immortalised forever as <mark>‘Bloody Sunday’</mark>, would change that, and the course of the conflict forever. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring a peaceful protest, members of the British Parachute Regiment opened fire on a crowd of protesters that had gathered in Londonderry (Derry), tragically killing 14 civilians and injuring a further 14, after believing they had been fired upon themselves from within the crowd.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe Widgery Tribunal, hastily held by the British government and completed in only 12 weeks, concluded that the troops’ actions had been ‘bordering on reckless’, but crucially, accepted their testimonies that they had opened fire in reaction to armed gunmen. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe findings of the enquiry shocked the Northern Irish community as many eye-witness reports, including those given by Irish and British journalists, contradicted the supposed official timeline. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA follow up enquiry concluded in 2010 would overturn the original report, instead declaring the army had acted unjustifiably and had been the first ones to open fire, significantly, at unarmed civilians.  However, the damage had already been long since done. \r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of Bloody Sunday the PIRA ratcheted up its armed campaign, undoubtedly rejuvenated by a raft of new recruits who had been horrified by the actions of the British Army. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the Official IRA beat their former partners to the punch with a deadly attack on a military barracks in the Aldershot area of England only a few weeks after Bloody Sunday, it would not take the PIRA long to join in too.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the 8th of March 1973 the PIRA retaliated in full force with its first operation in England, killing one person and injuring 265 others with car bombs in London, an attack that was a deadly first blow and a sign of things to come for the British capital.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/The-scene-after-an-IRA-bomb-Old-Bailey.jpg\" alt=\"The Troubles\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <sub><q>The scene after an IRA bomb exploded outside the Old Bailey in central London in 1973 which killed one person and injured 200 people. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons.</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nIn many ways Bloody Sunday acted as the perfect justification for the PIRA to target London and reinforced the ideologies they already held. Innocent civilians had been killed by the British army and demand for retaliation against the establishment on the British mainland was high within the PIRA. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>Why target London? </h1>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nFor the PIRA, the start of the bombing campaign in London was about more than just getting revenge. An assault on the capital made sense from a strategic point of view as there were several crucial ways in which attacks on the city were able to help advance their agenda. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn short, by expanded their bombing campaign, the PIRA believed they would create the three elements necessary to facilitate the creation of a free united Ireland: fear, support, and pressure. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirstly, it brought the war out of its Irish confines, and directly onto the streets of England, thus creating fear. The support would be created because it also provided an opportunity for the group to generate more exposure through propaganda. Pressure would also be created through the general public’s fear, and the significant damage to the UK economy the campaign would cause. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Wormwood-Street-London-Irish-Republican-Army.jpg\" alt=\"The Troubles\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <sub><q>The Bishopsgate bombing which occurred on 24 April 1993. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons.</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nThe support part of this plan might seem unusual for a paramilitary force, but as a relatively small group the PIRA needed to publicise itself and its mission. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ranks of the organisation were made up of volunteer recruits, therefore successful operations in London - one of the most famous cities in the world - naturally acted as the perfect advert to attract new members. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore importantly than this though was the fact the PIRA, at least in the initial phases of the Troubles, had a small support base in the UK it believed it could tap into. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nBritish backing for the Republicans can be bizarrely exemplified by John Lennon, who amongst penning a song entitled ‘Sunday Bloody Sunday’, also appeared at a London protest march in 1972 carrying a sign inscribed with the words: ‘For the IRA against British Imperialism.’ \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/john-lennon.jpg\" alt=\"IRA\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>John Lennon at a London protest march in 1972 carrying a sign. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTommy McKearney, a former member of the PIRA explains in his book that, <mark>‘it seemed to many Irish Republicans that only by detonating explosives in England would they keep the British population aware of what their government was doing.’</mark>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe rationale behind this was that hitting London would generate headline news stories about the Troubles on an international level, the publicity it got would highlight the groups plight and in turn generate more support like that seen at the solidarity marches. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnder a presumed mountain of pressure from supporters and those also reacting in fear, the British government would eventually be forced to withdraw the UK from Northern Ireland.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis master plan was too naïve and failed to achieve the PIRA’s desired results, the government stood strong on the topic for the duration of the conflict. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/\r\ngirl-in-the-ira.jpg\" alt=\"IRA\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The PIRA had many women supporters as well as active members of Active Service Units (ASU\'s) conducting operations within Northern Ireland and Europe. The most famous of these was Donna Maguire who was described as the most dangerous woman in Europe where she served as a member of an ASU based in the Hague and targeting British soldiers in Germany.  <i>Source: Wikimedia</i></q></sub>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nThe group also never received the level of public backing it needed, the Troubles coincided with a difficult period of history for the British working-class, who were naturally too preoccupied with more pressing domestic issues. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA fourth element that influenced the PIRA’s decision to divert some of their attention across the Irish Sea, was the fact it gave the group the opportunity to attack softer targets. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe success the group had enjoyed in Northern Ireland had proven to be a double-edged sword, as the security forces that opposed them had been forced to up their game. In comparison, London - and other locations on the UK mainland - were less prepared, more vulnerable and now viable targets.  \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite being on home ground in Northern Ireland, the PIRA was also unable to fully get the upper hand on the British Armed Forces and Royal Ulster Constabulary, who thanks to superior numbers and resources, were able to establish a foothold in the region. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis therefore put the IRA Army Council (the decision-making body of the PIRA) in a difficult position and forced it to look elsewhere for opportunities to strike at its opponents. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOperations on the British mainland and London in particular became a viable alternative for this reason as they made sense from a military perspective. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe city, despite being 500 miles away from the PIRA’s South Armagh heartland, was less secure and prepared for attacks at that time, and was consequently the perfect place to initiate a guerrilla warfare-based campaign against the British establishment. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/rira_m16_attacks.jpg\" alt=\"RIRA M16 Attacks\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>On Wednesday 20 September 2000, the Real Irish Republican Army carried out an attack on MI6 in Vauxhall, Lambeth, London. <i>Source: BBC </i></q></sub>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcross the entirety of the Troubles, fifteen British Army personnel lost their lives during the PIRA’s coordinated assaults on London’s military establishments.  What is alarming to consider is the fact that the majority of these people were actually killed on just one fatal day. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the 20th of July 1982 PIRA were able to detonate two bombs within a couple of hours of each other in Hyde Park and Regents Park. These places of natural beauty quickly became more reminiscent of a battlefield as eleven soldiers and seven military horses lost their lives in the blasts. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe assaults were so successful because the PIRA had opportunistically taken advantage of the more relaxed atmosphere of the city. The eleven soldiers killed had been conducting their daily duties, in full display of the general public. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/bbc-mi6-bomb.jpg\" alt=\"RIRA M16 Attacks\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Damage caused by the missile attack on the MI6 building <i>Source: BBC </i></q></sub>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nThe four lost in Hyde Park had been conducting the daily Changing of the Guard, while the seven killed in Regents Park had been performing music from Oliver!. Despite being in the middle of a bloody conflict both of the events had still been advertised to the public, and were consequently ripe for the PIRA to target.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe PIRA made no attempt to hide why it chose to attack London, in the groups various ‘Green Book’ induction manuals it explicitly laid out a list of strategy guidelines for new recruits to adhere to. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe opening bullet point makes direct reference to the ideas we have already explored, stating all IRA attacks were part of; ‘A War of attrition against enemy personnel which is aimed at causing as many casualties and deaths as possible so as to create a demand from their people at home for their withdrawal.’ \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/greennbook.jpg\" alt=\"IRA\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The Green Book is a training and induction manual issued by the Irish Republican Army to new volunteers. It was used by the post-Irish Civil War Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Cumann na mBan, (“League of Women”), along with later incarnations such as the Provisional IRA (PIRA). It includes a statement of military objectives, tactics and conditions for military victory against the British government. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe manuals second point further explains the rationale behind many of the PIRA’s other attacks when it says; ‘A bombing campaign aimed at making the enemy’s financial interest in our country unprofitable while at the same time curbing long term financial investment in our country.’ \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs an internationally renowned trade hub, the center of British affluence and home to much of the establishment, London was the perfect place for the PIRA to inflict as much economic damage on Britain as it could. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/HAC_MainBuilding.jpg\" alt=\"Artillery Company Attack\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>On 9 June 1990, the Provisional IRA detonated a time bomb inside the Armoury House hall of the Honourable Artillery Company\'s military barracks in London, England.

The IRA used the Mark 10 design during the Downing Street attack, which had a smaller explosive charge between 44-200 pounds (20 -100 Kgs) of explosives but had multiple barrels. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe PIRA were able to routinely inflict heavy losses on the city of London, like those seen during the Walton’s attack, through the deployment of a varied and sophisticated arsenal of weapons. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAndy Oppenheimer, an historian who has examined the operational practices of the IRA explains that over time the Provisional army became highly efficient in the use of those tools, ‘They were in the IRA for life and learned their skills over many years. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey had a proper training program where each engineer passed on their knowledge to others in a classroom.’ These where not amateurish or opportunistic individuals but highly trained and adaptable, this in turn ensured they were able to undertake a wide array of different missions, ranging from assassination and shootings, to bombings and mortar attacks. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat’s more, over the course of the Troubles the group was able to develop and upgrade their often homemade weapons. The car bomb, a sinister staple of their arsenal that was used in attacks such as the one in Hyde Park in 1982 and was often rigged with a timer or remote control detonator, eventually gave way to the much more destructive fertiliser bomb. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/hyde-park-deaths.jpg\" alt=\"IRA\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Carcasses of horses of the Household Cavalry lie in the road following the Hyde Park bomb attack <i>Source: Corbis // Independent.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSix attacks carried out towards the end of the conflict in the 1990s that used these new weapons have been cited by historians such as Paul Rogers as a marked beginning of a new phase in the war, and perfectly demonstrate the phenomenon of weapon development in action. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Baltic exchange attack on the 10th of April 1992 - the first lorry based fertiliser bomb attack on the British mainland – was at that time the biggest detonation in London since the Luftwaffe’s assaults during the Second World War, scarily it was trumped again almost exactly a year later. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Bishopsgate attack on the 24th of April 1993 saw the deployment of a massive 1 tonne ANFO bomb, a tool originally conceived to clear large areas of space in heavy industries such as mining. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo put that into perspective, a regular car bomb like the one used in the Harrods attack in 1983 often weighed around 30lb, a mere fraction compared to the 2204lb bomb that was unleashed a decade later. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe fallout from the Bishopsgate blast was so devastating that a large mushroom cloud billowed out above the 15-foot wide crater that had been left behind in the spot where the vehicle had once stood, photos of the devastation taken in the immediate aftermath of the destruction also bare a haunting similarity to those taken during the height of the Blitz.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/bishopgate-bombing.jpg\" alt=\"IRA\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The fallout from the Bishopsgate blast was so devastating <i>Source: City of London Police.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 1993 attack on Bishopsgate would also hold the unsavoury record of being the single most financially costly attack in world history for a considerable amount of time, with the estimated £1 billion worth of damage only being surpassed by the September 11th attacks on the United States in 2001.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe PIRA never stood still during the Troubles, to effectively wage its war against the British establishment it was essential for the group to be resourceful, the relentless development and evolution of their weapons being the ultimate showcase of this. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe pace at which they continued to break new ground was remarkable, with this arms race there naturally came an increased sense of boldness. Political assassinations were frequently attempted or enacted by the PIRA, as was the case in 1979 when Queen Elizabeth II’s cousin Lord Louis Mountbatten had been killed. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, thanks to their weaponry they audaciously came within touching distance of completing one of their main objectives in 1991. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 7th of February of that year could have easily gone down in British history as a day of infamy, as on that specific Thursday, the IRA chose to deploy a carefully prepared mortar attack on 10 Downing Street, the very heart of British politics. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/downing_st_mortar.jpg\" alt=\"IRA\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Mortar attack on 10 Downing street. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nThree giant 4½ foot long shells were propelled towards a packed Cabinet meeting from a homemade mortar, which had been stored in the back of a modified Ford Transit van. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe projectiles would ultimately fail to meet their mark and subsequently dealt minimal damage, the nearest shell would however, fall a mere 30 metres away from the entirety of the British Cabinet. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe event was still a landmark occasion, whilst mortars had been used frequently in Northern Ireland this instance was the first recorded deployment of such a weapon on English soil. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Real Irish Republican Army, an offshoot of the PIRA formed following the Good Friday Agreement, would continue to break historic new ground in a similar fashion to its forbearer on the 20th of September 2000, when a RPG-22 anti-tank rocket was launched harmlessly at the headquarters of MI6. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h3> The consequences of the London attacks </h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThere can be no real debate that the biggest consequence of the PIRA’s long reign of terror in London was a tragic list of casualties. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe groups staunch commitment to their mission and ability to deploy sophisticated weapons meant that forty-eight men and women were killed in the city across the entirety of the conflict.  Twenty-eight of these victims, a clear majority, were unarmed innocent civilians going about their daily lives. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to the fifteen soldiers we previously talked about in this article, it should also not be forgotten that five members of the Metropolitan Police Force were also killed as they actively sought to keep the population of the capital safe. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Bombing-in-Belfast.jpg\" alt=\"IRA\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nEven though the PIRA never explicitly declared any desire to kill members of the public, some historians have suggested it is doubtful that they were naive enough to believe their attacks posed no threat to their lives. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA regular element of their attacks on the city’s businesses was the issuing of an indirect coded warning to the police, even in circumstances where these messages were received a subsequent successful evacuation was still never guaranteed. As was the case of an attack on the 9th of February 1996 when two civilians were killed by a PIRA bomb following an unsuccessful evacuation order.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe reason why so many people were caught up in the groups activities was because they routinely sought to inflict financial damage to the capital as a part of their economic warfare campaign. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile they undoubtedly inflicted large financial damages to the pockets of London’s establishments, and even as Rogers’s has pointed out likely damaged the city’s tourist reputation, they failed to achieve their ultimate goal.  The British government ultimately had a much larger pool of wealth to tap into than the PIRA, and at no point did the Troubles become a war they could not financially afford. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe steadfast determination of the citizen’s of London to carry on in the face of financial ruin was further demonstrated by the owners of the Harrods’s department store, who after being attacked by the PIRA in 1983, defiantly reopened their store only three days after it had been defaced. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn a less quantifiable level, the city of London is most likely now better able to deal with acts of aggression in the present, as a result of the IRA’s relentless campaign. In a way, initiatives such as the ‘ring of steel’ - a system of checkpoints constructed around the city designed to monitor incoming vehicles and check for PIRA bombs - can be viewed as a precursor to similar measures used to prevent attacks in the 21st century, and demonstrates how the city has learnt from the past. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/p-check.jpg\" alt=\"IRA\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Members of the Royal Regiment of Wales perform a Personal Check (P Check) in 1979.

As has been mentioned, the IRA considered itself to be an army, it is therefore significant that there was no military surrender or capitulation on their part. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Good Friday Agreement, signed in 1998, was a major landmark political achievement that has shaped the relationship between the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ever since, with continued peace and harmony between all parties involved being the most welcome consequence.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, the IRA continued to function - in numerous forms - as an organisation all the way up to 2005, with many of its former members likely still being alive and informally active in their communities to this day as a result. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/good-friday-agreement.jpg\" alt=\"IRA\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The front cover of the Good Friday Agreement, signed by the participants. <i>Source: Whytes.</i></q></sub>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nWhile the Good Friday Agreement had demanded the complete disarmament of all paramilitary groups it would take the IRA nearly a decade to comply and formally end its campaign in the mid-2000s. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe legacy of the Irish Republican Army’s decades long assault on the British capital has mostly been put to the back of the British public’s conscious since then. In a way this is perfectly understandable, new threats that are often more complicated to understand have risen up to replace them.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, as Britain is currently in the complicated and ugly process of rediscovering its place in Europe the topic of Northern Ireland and Ireland will undoubtedly continue to crop up. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAgainst this current backdrop it is therefore more important than ever to keep in mind the events of the Troubles of the past, so as to ensure the same bloodshed is not witnessed again in Ireland and the United Kingdom.\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Further Reading:</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nIf you only have a limited amount of time to delve into the complicated topic of the Troubles, I would highly recommend you check-out <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bandit-Country-IRA-South-Armagh/dp/0340717378\" target=\"_blank\">Toby Harnden’s Bandit Country </a>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe book is a thoroughly engrossing gateway into the topic and offers a perfect window into the world of the IRA and is an essential read for those interested in the subject.

In 1599 Shakespeare (along with four other men) bought a single share for the famous Globe Theatre, which is now called ‘Shakespeare’s Globe’ in homage to the playwright. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Globe is located in Southwark (although it is a reconstruction) and visitors can tour the iconic theatre and learn more about Shakespeare’s history and ties to the theatre and the City. This painting is an important one, as it is the image, we primarily see being associated with Shakespeare however, this image is not a definite portrait of him.  \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot much is known about the portrait however, many believe it may have been painted by John Taylor and that it has good claim to be a life portrait of Shakespeare. The portrait is known as ‘Chandos Portrait’, after a previous owner, and it was the first ever portrait which was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in 1856. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.

After studying law at Manchester University, Christabel joined the Womens Social and Political Union (WSPU) which was established by her mother Emmeline Pankhurst in 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe WSPU’s main aim was to campaign for Women’s right to vote, and as Christabel was a charismatic and persuasive speaker, she was in charge of organising rallies, processions and campaigns of civil disobedience such as bombing and arson attacks. Her contribution was recognised in 1936, when she was made a Dame in honour of her dedication to female emancipation. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThis portrait was first shown at the Womens Exhibition which was organised by the WSPU in 1909- Note the integration of the Suffragette tricolour, which represented loyalty and dignity, purity and hope, which all WSPU members were encouraged to strive for and integrate themselves into their every-day lives. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Food and Drink facilities:</h4> <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nYes, there are food at drink facilities at the Gallery. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\nPortrait Restaurant offers breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea or dinner, with incredible views of Trafalgar Square down to the Houses of Parliament. \r\nPortrait Café serves light snack food such as sandwiches, salads, soups, cakes and coffee. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/national-portrait-gallery-image6.jpg\" alt=\"National Portrait Gallery\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br><sub><q>Inside the National Portrait Gallery <i>Source: NPG, London </i></q></sub>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe Friday Lates Bar opens every Friday from 6pm-8:30 and offers beers, prosecco, wine or gins.  \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h4>Tours:</h4> \r\nYes, Tours are available at the National Portrait Gallery. \r\nYou can customise and plan your own tour based on Time Period, Theme or Recent Acquisitions online on the Gallery website (please see the link below) \r\n \r\n<a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/explore/tours \" target=\"_blank\"> The National Portrait Gallery / Tours </a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Nearest station/Tube:</h4> <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe nearest tube stations are Charing Cross (approx. a 3-5-minute walk) and Leicester Square (approx. a 5-6-minute walk). \r\n\r\n<h4>Bus routes:</h4> <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nRoutes 3, 6, 9, 11, 13, 15, 23, 24, 87, 91, 139, and 176 stops at Trafalgar Square.\r\n\r\n<h4>Postcode/address:</h4> <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nNational Portrait Gallery St Martin’s Place, London, WC2H 0HE.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Accessibility:</h3> <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nConcessionary rates apply to young people aged 12-18, disabled visitors, senior citizens, ES40 cardholders and students in full-time education.

Located in the ‘Ancient Egypt and Sudan’ department in the Grand Court, the Rosetta Stone is perhaps the museums most famous and most visited exhibit and people can always be found surrounding it and taking pictures. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Rosetta Stone is a granodiorite stele (a form of slab which was erected in the ancient world as a monument, usually used for funerary of commemorative purposes) and is perhaps one of the world’s most famous Ancient artefacts. Created on behalf of King Ptolemy V in 196 BC, the Rosetta stone is an important composition of three decrees in Egyptian hieroglyphic script, Demotic script (used in the Nile delta) and Ancient Greek. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe stone was rediscovered in 1799 by a French soldier named Pierre-Francois Bouchard during the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt, but was re-possessed by the British in 1802 following a French defeat in battle. The stone has been on public display at the British Museum, almost continuously, since 1802. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.

Behind each goal was placed a portable engine, each of which drove two dynamo machines that powered the lights. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Leeds Mercury (15 October 1878) reported that “…the rays, which were of great brilliancy, lighted nearly the whole of the ground, and the players could be seen almost as clear as at noonday,” noting that “the illuminating power was equal to 8,000 standard candles, and the cost per hour for each light is 31s. 2d.” \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe excitement and novelty of the event was made apparent: “When the light was turned on the great crowd cheered loudly, and then watched the game with great interest.

Originally from Torslanda, Sweden, Elisabeth Gustafsdotter moved to Gothenburg in 1862 and was registered as a prostitute in March 1865.

By 1882 her marriage had fallen apart and she made a living predominantly through sewing and cleaning, with occasional sex work. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nEven though she cohabited with Michael Kidney, it was not rare for her to spend a few nights in the lodging houses, especially 32 Flower and Dean Street. Her lodgers described her as a quiet and kind woman, although she did often appear before the Thames Magistrate Court on account of drunk and disorderly behaviour. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nOn the 26th September 1888, a group of women sat in the kitchen of no. 32 talking about the Whitechapel murders, greatly worried they were at risk of becoming victims themselves.

In 1888, however, it went by the name Buck’s Row and was the site of the first accepted Jack the Ripper murder. On the morning of 31st August 1888, Mary Ann Nichols, known as Polly, was found towards the middle of the street on the south side pavement, a few metres down from the old boarding school continues to stand tall today. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nMarried to William Nichols in 1864, Polly was clearly unsettled in her domestic life. As stated in the London Daily News (3/9/1888), she separated from her husband “four or five times, if not six” according to William. The newspaper also reveals that she left her husband because he “‘turned nasty’ over another man”.

She left her husband for the final time in 1881, and by 1882 she had begun to support herself through sex work. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nWilliam found out about her new means of income and consequently refused to continue paying her alimony.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nBetween April 1882 and May 1888 she was mainly staying at Lambeth Workhouse, with short stints with family or other workhouses around East London.

A resident of the washhouse, the back of which faced the murder, said she heard nothing until the police whistle and someone knock on her door. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice’s injuries were eerily similar to the victims of Jack the Ripper: her throat had been cut, her skirts crumpled up beneath her chin to reveal abdominal cuts. These wounds, however, were not as deep as the ones inflicted the year before. Given the climactic severity of the wounds found on Mary Kelly, this lighter touch with Alice seems highly dubious. Dr Bagster Phillips, who also attended the examinations of Mary Jane Kelly, Annie Chapman, and Elizabeth Stride, attested that the cause of death was blood loss not strangulation as in the previous cases, and also the injuries were unlike what he had seen before.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/castle-street-image2.jpg\" alt=\"Castle Alley\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <sub><q>View of Old Castle Street with Castle Alley in the distance.

What may have started out as a pleasant day for most, ended in grief and shock for some. Crime was a constant concern in East London and around 1-2 murders a month were reported.  The news of the Bank Holiday murder spread like wildfire across London.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nMartha Tabram was like many other women in the East End. Born in 1849, she drank heavily and tried to earn a living through selling trinkets and prostitution.

It is alleged that she suffered from fits, precisely why we do not know, but her later partner, Henry Turner, knew that the fits were exacerbated by drinking. Henry Tabram gave her 12 shillings for three years before reducing it to half a crown (2s 6d). This harsh deduction was due to the fact that Martha was living with Henry Turner, who worked as a carpenter.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nShe was living at Satchell’s Lodging House at 19 George Street in Spitalfields in August 1888 and was working on the streets that evening. She and a colleague had picked up clients and parted ways shortly before midnight. Martha went into George Yard, now Gunthorpe Street, and was found on the first floor landing of George Yard Buildings early the next morning. Alfred Crow was returning from work as a cab driver when he saw her body, but as he thought it was a homeless person, he continued up to bed.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/george-yard-image2.jpg\" alt=\"George Yard\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <sub><q>The Murder at George\'s Yard, Whitechapel road. <i>Source: Wikicommons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nBooth’s poverty map shows the Yard buildings to be ‘fairly comfortable’, however the other side of the street is black, meaning that these dwellings were the very poorest and housed criminals.

There is still debate as to whether Martha was a victim of Jack the Ripper as the majority of her wounds were to her stomach and groin, which became a “trademark” of the murderer. Furthermore, a large cut about 3x1 inches was incised into her abdomen. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nShe was stabbed a total of 39 times with a small blade. As there were no signs of strangulation as would be typical of a Ripper victim, it was concluded that she died of blood loss.

(71, 'Miller\'s Court - Dorset Street', 'There are only a few minute pockets of London that Charles Booth considered to be of the ‘lowest class’, ‘vicious’ and ‘semi-criminal’. Dorset Street and its narrow alleyways harboured this notorious reputation. Thick strokes of black coat the street on Booth’s poverty map from the late 19th century. The notebooks linked to this map describe Dorset Street as “the worst street in respect of - poverty, misery, vice - of the whole of London. A cesspool into which had sunk the foulest & most degraded.” \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nLodging houses, colloquially called doss houses, dominated the pavements and thus giving it the nickname ‘Dosset Street’. Miller’s Court was a small courtyard, accessed through an archway, featuring small rooms for rent. These were built by the lodging house landlord John Miller who owned numbers 30, 27, and 26, as he wanted to capitalise on the demand for cheap accommodation. The houses at 30 and 27 were later acquired by John McCarthy during the 1880s and 1890s.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe gentrification of the Spitalfields area in recent years has seen an end to the extreme poverty and horrific crimes and Dorset Street is no more.

From there, it is possible she left with a client for France. The large English communities there had a high demand for prostitutes. The brothels were like traps; the women couldn’t go out without a chaperone, the money they earned was seldom enough, and leaving completely was scarcely an option. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nMary returned to England quite quickly and ended up in Whitechapel. How and why she went there, along with much of her life, is unknown to us. From early 1888, Mary lived in Miller’s Court with Joseph Barnett, her partner with whom she had lived since 1887. In Summer 1888, Joseph lost his job and couldn’t support Mary anymore; she turned to prostitution and their relationship fell apart. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/millers-court-image2.jpg\" alt=\"Miller\'s Court\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <sub><q> Contemporary sketch of John McCarthy. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nJoseph continued to visit and send her money as often as possible.

She told me too she was heartily sick of the life she was leading, and wished she had money enough to go back to Ireland, where her people lived.

The canonical victims, i.e. those known to have been killed by Jack the Ripper with their death dates are as follows: <mark>Mary Ann “Polly” Nichols (31st August), Annie Chapman (8th September), Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes (30th September), and Mary Jane Kelly (9th November).</mark>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the passing of 130 years, the killer’s identity is still a mystery and was known as the Whitechapel Murderer until Scotland Yard received a letter on the 29th September 1888. The “Dear Boss” letter, written in neat, Roundhand script with red ink, features the writer taunting the police - <mark>“they won’t fix me just yet. … How can they catch me now.” - and finally signed “Yours truly Jack the Ripper”.</mark> The publication of this letter meant that his nickname caught like wildfire and was henceforth used by people from all levels of society.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image2.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <br> <sub><q>The first page of the \"Dear Boss\" letter <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAccording to the Illustrated Police News on the 20th October 1888, police were sifting through “upwards of seven hundred letters” all relating to the Jack the Ripper case.  It can be estimated that over 1000 letters were sent by the end of the case. By the end of October, he had murdered four of the canonical five women and police were no closer to finding him. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nMost of these letters, some 300 of which are still kept at the Corporation of London Records Office, were deemed as hoaxes. There is a small handful, however, that is taken seriously by experts and those interested in the cold case: the aforementioned <mark>“Dear Boss” letter</mark>, the <mark>“Saucy Jacky” postcard</mark>, and the <mark>“From Hell” letter</mark> (also known as the Lusk letter as it was directed to George Lusk). \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAll of these were signed “Jack the Ripper” and the content was such that the police paid special attention to them. The Lusk letter from 15th October 1888 in particular was concerning; <mark>a human kidney accompanied it </mark> which was significant as two weeks earlier, Catherine Eddowes was found murdered with her left kidney missing.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image3.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Facsimile of the front of the \"Saucy Jacky\" postcard. <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this may seem proof, it has never been ascertained whether or not this was Catherine’s kidney.

In the stairwell of 108-119 Model Dwellings in Goulston Street, a piece of cloth was found by Constable Alfred Long. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThis filthy scrap was part of Catherine Eddowes apron, who was killed mere hours prior, and was stained with blood. Above the apron on the wall or jamb of the building’s entrance was written <mark>“The Juwes are the men that will not be blamed for nothing”.</mark> Transcriptions differ as we have no photographic evidence; the police thought it best to wash the message away to avoid stirring any anti-Semitic tensions given that the area had a large Jewish community. But, like many clues connected with the Jack the Ripper case, we have no way of knowing if this graffiti is actually linked to the murders.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image4.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Copy of graffito in Goulston Street, attached to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Charles Warren\'s report to the Home Office on the Whitechapel murders. <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<h3>The Police</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThoroughly disturbed from the beginning, the police formed the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee. Led by George Lusk (yes, the same man who received a random kidney in the post), groups of volunteers patrolled the East End streets at night in an attempt to catch the elusive killer. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image5.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>George Lusk, President of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee. <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nOn top of this, the Metropolitan Police (most notably the Whitechapel H division), City of London Police, and Scotland Yard were hard at work interviewing countless witnesses and suspects without any real leads. The key witness statements they obtained lacked immense amounts of detail which made it difficult to form a precise picture of what had happened. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nRecently experts have deduced that he must have been a very typical, ordinary person with the ability to blend into the background without arousing any suspicion which only adds to the difficulties the police faced.  Timing was also not in the Metropolitan Police’s favour: they were put under great stress as there were shifts and instability in leadership which damaged officer morale. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the technology and procedures available at the time were not sufficient for this kind of investigation. Fingerprinting, Crime Scene Investigation, crime scene photography, and forensics were all to be discovered several years later - fingerprinting was only implemented as standard procedure in 1901 - without these thorough investigative techniques we use today, it would have been extraordinarily difficult to find the murderer. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image6.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Use of fine powder and brush to reveal latent fingerprints. <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nIf these murders happened now, the Ripper would have been found after the first murder. DNA profiling is a gift to crime scenes, it is the control+F of perpetrator identification.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>Suspects</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nAs the police did not have enough evidence to prosecute any suspect, the public let their imaginations run wild and numerous theories, both feasible and a little less believable, were thought up. At the time the police had their suspects, the favoured one being <mark> George Chapman (born Seweryn Kłosowski)</mark> who emigrated to London from Poland just before the murders began. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHe also had a track record of poisoning his wives. Also from Poland was <mark>Aaron Kosminski.</mark> This man spent a great deal of time in an insane asylum but there isn’t really anything to firmly suggest he murdered several women. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image7.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>George Chapman (December 14, 1865 - April 7, 1903) was the English name taken by serial killer Seweryn Antonowicz Kłosowski. <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThen we have <mark>‘Leather Apron’, whose real name was John Pizer or Piser,</mark> also of Polish origin. There was absolutely no evidence for him being the murderer apart from the fact that he may have committed minor assaults on prostitutes and in fact, he had alibis for two out of five murders.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most curious suspect was <mark>Francis Tumblety,</mark> he was a quack doctor from the United States with an impressive moustache if the photographs and drawings are anything to go by. He is said to have been a misogynist with a strong loathing for prostitutes in particular and once showed a friend his display of preserved uteri at a dinner party. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image8.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Photo of Francis Tumblety <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThis along with the American nature we have seen in the alleged authentic letters, plus a knowledge of human anatomy, all points to a likely suspect. The uterine collection, however, has not been proved, nor has the authenticity of the letters. Once again, evidence falls through.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe press and public had their opinions, of course. <mark>Thomas Neill Cream</mark> was a name that cropped up often. He was also a doctor specialising in abortions - bonus point for female anatomical knowledge; and had previously poisoned several women - another point for being able to kill someone; all signs so far point to him being a likely suspect. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nExcept, he was in Illinois between 1881 and 1891 serving time for his crimes, meaning there was no way he could have been in London in 1888 terrorising Whitechapel. There is apparently the possibility, according to some Jack the Ripper enthusiasts, that Cream had a double who killed the five, or more, women in London. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image9.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Photo of Dr. Thomas Neill Cream. <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nDespite the unlikelihood of him being Jack the Ripper, it is alleged that his last words before execution were <mark>“I am Jack…” </mark>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nOther suspects include males who personally knew the victims, such as <mark>George Hutchinson and Joseph Barnett</mark> who both knew Mary Jane Kelly.

Theories surrounding him differ but can all be nullified by the fact that he was at Balmoral during the murders of Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image11.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Prince Albert Victor. <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nIn 2017, a controversial new theory was put forth: that Jack the Ripper was actually H.H. Holmes, commonly referred to as ‘America’s First Serial Killer’. A series entitled American Ripper, shown on the History channel, explores the determination of Holmes’ great-great-grandson to prove his theory that the two killers were one and the same. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nGranted, there is no record to show that Holmes was in America during the Whitechapel murders, and there is proof he visited London at some point. He also fits the vague descriptions eye witness accounts gave at the time, he had extensive medical knowledge, and went on to kill somewhere between 20 and 200 people from 1891 to 1894, some murders may have been committed during his youth as well. Once again however, the evidence and claims are pure speculation.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image12.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Born Herman Webster Mudgett, also known as Dr. Henry Howard Holmes or H. H. Holmes <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nIn amongst all the far-fetched or tenuous theories, suspects without firm evidence against them, and quasi-scientific documentaries claiming they’ve finally found the killer, there is only one theory I have come across that puts forth reasonable claims with undeniably eery coincidences. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nCharles Cross was a carman who worked at the Broad Street Depot as a deliveryman and was found by the body of Polly Nichols after she had been killed. Christer Holmgren, a Swedish journalist, has studied the Jack the Ripper case for over 30 years and noticed what most of us had skimmed over. The documentary based on his theory explains the details and discrepancies that make it exceedingly difficult to dispute.   \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>The Victims</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n<mark>Polly Nichols</mark> is usually considered the first victim, the woman before her being Martha Tabram who was found in George Yard Buildings with 39 stab wounds to her torso. Polly was found with her throat cut down to the spine and with a number of wounds to her lower abdomen in Buck’s Row. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<mark>Annie Chapman</mark> was found a little over a week later in a Hanbury Street back garden, also with her throat cut to the bone except the killer had now escalated his violence and mutilated her abdomen. Parts of her abdominal wall, navel, uterus, vagina, and bladder were missing from her body. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image13.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Newspaper detailing the events surrounding the murders <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<mark>Elizabeth Stride</mark> also had a near-severed head, along with <mark>Catherine Eddowes.</mark> Elizabeth, however, bore no further wounds and this is typically boiled down to the assumption the murderer was interrupted by the approaching footsteps of Louis Diemschutz.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThis then explains Catherine’s murder committed 45 minutes later; her uterus and left kidney was not with the body. It is also with Catherine that we see facial wounds as well. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHowever, the most horrific and stomach-churning of the murders is that of <mark>Mary Jane Kelly.</mark> One almost condemns the use of crime scene photography in this case as it is inconceivable that someone would perform such brutality on another person. Another difference in Mary’s case is that she was killed and mutilated inside her own room as opposed to out on the street. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image14.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Mary Jane Kelly - Illustrated Police News <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nExactly why, though, nobody really knows but what we can assume is that the private room gave the Ripper more time to satisfy his bloodlust. She was unrecognisable by the time he had fled. Most of her organs had been removed and placed around her or next to her bed and large quantities of flesh were stripped off, exposing bone in the process. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThis was truly the pinnacle of Jack the Ripper’s merciless reign and it had left its mark on the entirety of the district. What is perhaps most fascinating with his modus operandi is that he consistently strangled these women before cutting their throats and mutilating them which strongly suggests that he did not want to cause them pain. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nSuffocation is one of the most painless ways to die so it could be implied that the murderer felt some kind of sympathy towards the women and he was not completely sadistic. Alternatively, he knew that the blood would splatter if the women were still alive and they would be more likely to scream, leading to his capture.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image15.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Streets in White Chapel, where the murders took place <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nWhitechapel was not a desirable location for anyone. It is stereotyped as an over-crowded, impoverished, miserable place, covered by the soot and pollution from nearby coal factories and this stereotype is entirely true. Most inhabitants were poor, there were numerous pubs, sometimes two or more on one street which would feed the alcohol dependencies that many indulged. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHouses were small and it was not rare to have whole families of several members living in one room, perhaps taking in a lodger as they hadn’t enough money to live on.  Crime was rife, but rarely involved murder. Typically there was pickpocketing, assault, drunken offences and general petty crime so when murders began to happen with little space between, it really shook the population.  \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nWhen people noticed it was mainly prostitutes being targeted, this community began to honestly fear for their lives.\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Serial Killing in the 19th and 20th Centuries</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\nEven though Jack the Ripper eclipses most other serial killers, especially those during the same century, there were murderers that acted for a longer period of time or killed more people. At the beginning of the 19th century, Andreas Bichel killed two women between 1806 and 1808 after luring them to his fortune telling scam. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image16.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Picture of Andreas Bichel, The Bavarian Ripper <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHe attempted to kill three other women and has been dubbed the Mädchenschlächter, or ‘girl slaughterer’ and in the English speaking world, he is known as the Bavarian Ripper. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAcross the pond in Austin, Texas, the ‘Servant Girl Annihilator’ was guilty of 8 instances of murder and rape from 1884 until Christmas Eve 1885. He did not have the same victim profile that Jack the Ripper had; the three first women he killed were cooks and servants, the fourth was an 11 year old girl, then a heterosexual couple, and finally two women were murdered on Christmas Eve. Class and race seemed to have nothing to do with his attacks. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nThe murders only stopped when the police shot a man beating a woman in February 1886. The man died of his wound the next day. Curiously whilst Whitechapel residents speculated and feared Jack the Ripper, his Mexican counterpart was running amok from 1880-1908. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe Mexican Ripper or El Chalequero, real name Francisco Guerrero Pérez, killed around 20 prostitutes through strangulation and mutilation and left them in the Consulado River. He was known for being a virulent misogynist with a particular hatred for prostitutes.  Strangely enough, during the very same months as Jack the Ripper, body parts were turning up in the River Thames and around East London.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image18.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Picture of The Mexican Ripper, El Chalequero <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAt the time, the newspapers thought they were linked however it seems likely that the Thames Torso Murders, which took place between 1887-1889, were from other murderers. In these cases as well, whoever committed these murders was never found nor were there any clues or suspects.  In this sense, the dismemberment murders were even more of a mystery than the Jack the Ripper cases which the authorities and the media seemed to focus on. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nShortly after the London murders, the French Ripper began his spree from 1894 to 1897. Joseph Vacher, after attempting to kill himself twice - one of which left him with a partially paralysed face and a dodgy eye - stabbed, mutilated and raped 11 victims (one woman, five teenage girls and five teenage boys) but blamed his murders on the claim he had been bitten by a rabid dog as a child. After confessing to his crimes, he was executed by guillotine on New Year’s Eve 1898.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image19.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Picture of The French Ripper, Joseph Vacher. <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crimes of Jack the Ripper grotesquely manifested themselves in later murders throughout the following century, especially in Britain. During World War Two, Gordon Cummins decided to use the Blackout to his grim advantage. He joined the RAF and was participating in a training course in February 1942; he was in London for most of the month however his murderous rampage lasted a mere six days. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nOver barely a week he killed four women and heartlessly mutilated three of them. There seemed to be a sexual emphasis to his murders and had he not left his gas mask or his belt at the scenes of attempted attacks, it is possible he would have gone on to kill more women.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHe was arrested on 16th February 1942 and was eventually executed in June that year. There have been two more Ripper-like serial killers in England since then: “Jack the Stripper” who was active 1964-65 and the Yorkshire Ripper who killed between 1975 and 1980. The former murdered six prostitutes who were found by the River Thames. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image20-web.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Picture of Jack the Stripper. <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAll were found stripped of clothing hence the unknown killer’s nickname and the fact that these murders are often referred to as the ‘Nude Murders’. The latter murderer is a man named Peter Sutcliffe, who killed 13 women. Media have the tendency to claim that prostitutes were the victims however out of all his victims, only six were sex workers, meaning he targeted women in general. He received 20 life sentences for his crimes and is currently serving time in HM Prison Frankland, Durham. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>The Sensation of Jack the Ripper</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe modern murderers bring us to the modern age. Why exactly have we chosen to etch Jack the Ripper into our minds rather than any of the aforementioned murderers? It is in part to good timing and good publicity. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHe killed when transatlantic telegraphy was reliable and used frequently, meaning that the London news could be communicated across to North America as well as to Europe - something earlier criminals couldn’t do - and the local newspapers published letters allegedly from the killer himself. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nEarly on in the case he was given a name which is not only catchy but also adds drama and suspense, which the general public love. On top of this, the elusiveness he has succeeded in maintaining has only increased his infamy over the decades. With the years having turned into almost a century and a half, this relatively small serial killer case has become a worldwide murder mystery and regular people are attempting to achieve some kind of cold case fame through proving who Jack the Ripper was once and for all. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image21.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Jack the Ripper (1987 video game) <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nWhether or not it will ever be possible to definitively say who the murderer was, we cannot say. Technological advancements, a sudden discovery of firm evidence, and maybe a time machine could help. There is something fundamentally unique about 19th century England, and especially Victorian London which has been so glorified it has become a fashion and craft movement in itself, known as steampunk. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nBeing a chronological bridge between old and new in terms of technology and progress, the alluring magic of this romanticised era must have something to do with the popularity of Jack the Ripper and Victorian society in general.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image22.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>Jack the Ripper, Assasin\'s Creed Video Game<i>Source: Assasin\'s Creed Video Game </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Language and Jack the Ripper</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">	\r\nIt is the nature of human beings to crave answers and the massive question mark that is the identity of this murderer has led to decades of study on the part of armchair detectives. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nBut if we are to continue discussing Jack the Ripper and the women he killed, it is worthwhile to look at the manner in which we speak about them and especially the language writers are choosing to use. The way in which we speak about the victims is of utmost importance. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nUsually they are only referred to as “prostitutes” or sometimes “women” which is admittedly a touch better, yet that is all we hear from them. If we do read about their lives in non-specialised publications, the writing makes it such that they led “a deeply impoverished existence in the slums”, for example.  \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/jack-the-ripper-image23.jpg\" alt=\"Jack The Ripper\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"> <br> <sub><q>The Canonical Five<i>Source: Wikimedia Commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThis wording, whilst sounding good from a journalistic point of view, creates a particular setting in the reader’s mind and provides them with prejudices and assumptions that may not have been reality. It can cause the reader to forget about the individuals and prevent sympathising with them.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nNewspaper and magazine articles and documentaries in recent times have overly dramatised the events of Autumn 1888 to the point of farcical theatricality, all for the sake of viewers and readers. It is through this exaggerated interpretation that the media have belittled the women he murdered, linguistically undermining them and reducing them to mere objects in the situation.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThey fade away into the shadow of their killer. Language shapes the way we view the world and subsequently our opinions on it. Immediately identifying these women as ‘prostitutes’ is not only historically inaccurate but it is damaging to their identities as women. It implies that this is what they did as a job regularly and perhaps we don’t realise that unlike some sex workers today, they were more or less forced into it. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe victims tried to make money through other means, such as selling their possessions, cleaning, crocheting, and selling sex was really a last resort to stop them from starving and living on the streets. Furthermore, sex workers are a consistently marginalised part of society and a slew of misinformed myths surround them and their work. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAs Kate Lister succinctly phrases it, the word ‘prostitute’ has always been ‘linked to a state of dishonour’ thanks to its first definition and usage. There has also always been an air of violence and abuse surrounding sex workers which further adds to the perceived justification of the horrors they endured. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThis term ‘sex worker’ may seem like anachronistic political correctness however language needs to evolve as we reflect upon our society. The role of the historian is to look back on history as objectively as possible but how can we do that if we use words loaded with negative implications? \r\n', 'jack-the-ripper-header-image-mobile.jpg', 1, NULL, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, 0, 1, 0, 0, 'London, United Kingdom', ''),
(74, 'Grey Abbey', 'Grey Abbey, which lends its name to the village in which its situated, is a ruined 12th century Cistercian priory.

As a result of her religious patronage in life, Affreca was buried at the abbey and an effigy tomb erected. Although the abbey may lie in ruins, this effigy tomb can still be seen in the north wall of the choir.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAffreca was the daughter of the King of Man and wife of John de Courcy, the latter of whom was a key figure in the Anglo-Norman invasion of East Ulster. De Courcy is credited with the establishment of numerous sites and strongholds across the region, including Cathedral Hill, the Mound of Down, Inch Abbey, Carrickfergus and Dundrum, before his fall from power at the hands of Hugh de Lacy and King John. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/grey-abbey-image2.jpg\" alt=\"Grey Abbey\"> <br><sub><q> Photo of the mannequin of Affreca de Courcy at Carrickfergus Castle. Original caption: She\'s looking toward the Isle of Man. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>History of the Abbey</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nDespite its use as a priory from its founding in 1193, the stonework construction of the Abbey was not completed until 1230. Once completed, it was the first fully gothic style building in Ulster and it is great architectural importance. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Cistercian monks who colonised the abbey maintained close ties with the Cumberland church throughout the years, with abbots from Grey Abbey becoming abbots at Holmcultram in 1222 and 1237. However, the abbey\'s history is otherwise quite sparse. We do, however, know that it was destroyed and damaged many times. \r\n<br><br>\r\nFirstly, it was almost entirely destroyed at the hands of Edward Bruce\'s forces during his invasion (1315-1318). During the Elizabethan era, the monastery was destroyed during military operations and, in 1572, the site was burnt by Brian O\'Neill to prevent it acting as refuge for English colonists. \r\n<br><br>\r\nBy the late medieval period, Grey Abbey had fallen into decline and, along with hundreds of other monasteries and parishes, it fell to Henry VIII\'s Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1541. The Abbey lay in relative ruin until it (and its surrounding estate) was granted to the Montgomery family in 1607. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/grey-abbey-image3.jpg\" alt=\"Grey Abbey\"><br> <sub><q>The Dissolution of the monasteries was an event that happened from 1536 to 1540, when English King Henry VIII took away the land and money that the nuns and monks of the Roman Catholic church owned. ... He decided to create his own religion - the Church of England. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons </i></q></sub>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn 1626, Sir Hugh Montgomery undertook extensive refurbishments and converted the Abbey into a parish church that served the local community until 1778. As a result of the Montgomery family\'s custodianship, there are several memorial plaques in their name throughout the nave.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Abbey is now in the care of the Northern Ireland Environment Agency as a scheduled monument, meaning it is afforded protection under the state. The Friends of the Abbey group also run guided tours of the Abbey and look after the Physic Garden and Visitors\' Centre.\r\n<br>\r\n<h3>Things to look out for</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe Physic Garden is located at the entrance to the Abbey, by the Visitors\' Centre. It was designed to reflect the medicinal gardens usually found in medieval abbeys and monasteries. In the past, herbs and plants would\'ve been cultivated in these kinds of gardens to produce medicines and dyes, with many Cistercian monks becoming skilled botanists. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/grey-abbey-image4.jpg\" alt=\"Grey Abbey\"> <sub><q>The Physic Garden is located at the entrance to the Abbey, by the Visitors\' Centre. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons </i></q></sub>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTheir herbal remedies were used to treat a whole host of common ailments, with knowledge of herbalism deriving from Greek, Egyptian, Roman and Arabic texts as well as their own trial-and-error. Many modern medicines derive from plant sources, such as the use of Yew trees to produce chemotherapy drugs or poppies for the production of morphine. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIf you\'re visiting in the summer, during an especially dry period, you might be able to see parch marks in the grass around the cloister. These follow the original walls and mark features of the abbey that no longer survive above the surface. Sub-surface features can affect the growth of grass and other plants, by affecting the amount of moisture in the soil - this shows up as \'crop marks\' or \'parch marks\'. \r\n<br><br>\r\nMarks like these often help archaeologists identify new sites - during the especially dry summer of 2018, hundreds of new features were identified in the landscape across the UK and Ireland.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe gothic architecture of the Abbey is breath-taking, with dramatic arches, doorways and windows surviving amongst the ruins. Not only is it visually superb, but it is also architecturally significant, as Grey Abbey was the first fully gothic style building in the whole of Ulster. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/grey-abbey-image5.jpg\" alt=\"Grey Abbey\"> <sub><q>The gate to the grounds is open from 8:30am - 8pm. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons </i></q></sub>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nFrom its completion in 1230, the structure remained virtually unchanged until alterations in the 15th century saw its tower and chancel raised in height. \r\n<br><br>\r\nOn the south side of the nave are several impressive buttresses. However, upon closer inspection of the stonework, it becomes clear that these are modern additions. In the early 20th century, the nave faced collapse and in order to stabilise it, the Ministry of Public works carried out conservation work and constructed these buttresses. \r\n<br><br>\r\nDuring conservation or reconstruction of a site through modern additions, it is common practice to set them apart by using different coloured stone, mortar or different masonry patterns. This can also be seen throughout the Abbey in reconstructed and repaired walls.\r\n<br>\r\n<h3>Visitor Information</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nAdmission is free, although donations are encouraged to fund the upkeep of the grounds. There is a small Visitors\' Centre at the entrance, with an abundance of displays and activities - there\'s even the chance to dress up as a Cistercian monk. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIf you are driving to the site, there is a free-to-use car park and the area is well sign-posted.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn terms of accessibility, there is pedestrian and wheelchair access from the car park to the Visitors\' Centre and Physic Garden, but gravel and grass throughout the rest of the site might be difficult for some. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe site is open from 8.30am-8pm on weekdays, and 10am-8pm over the weekend.

A mansio resembled a very large house, but with addition of extended bathing facilities and accommodation for horses.\r\n\r\nEvidence from the site indicates that the mansio at Letocetum was focused around a central courtyard with a formal garden which acted as an informal gathering place for both guests and locals.  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Letocetum-image2.jpg\" alt=\"Letocetum\"> <sub><q>Letocetum Roman baths from St John\'s Wall <i>Source: wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nAdjacent to the mansio are the remains of Letocetum\'s bath house, which, according to the archaeological record, was in constant use for over 150 years. Whilst the baths underwent several modifications during this time, the structure conformed to the standard format found in bath houses across Roman Britain - comprising a cold bath, heated rooms, changing rooms and exercise hall. \r\n\r\nThe bath house was used by both the local inhabitants and the travellers visiting the mansio, consequently it continued to be an important feature of daily life in Letocetum until the town\'s eventual decline in the 4th century. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Letocetum-image3.jpg\" alt=\"Letocetum\"> <sub><q>St John\'s Church, Wall <i>Source: Wikimedia commons </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe site is managed by English Heritage and is open all year round and is free to enter.

As the Member of Parliament for Yorkshire, Wilberforce famously campaigned against the slave trade. \r\n<br />\r\n<br /><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nToday’s building, conveniently located next to the quayside and high street, was originally on the site of a merchant’s house built in c.1590 for the Lister family, exporters of lead. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nJohn Lister and his son, also John, both became Mayors of Hull and the latter was knighted. The family was prestigious enough to entertain Charles I, who stayed at the house in 1639. The current structure was built in 1656. From 1709, John Thornton, a merchant of lead and cloth, owned the house. The merchant’s apprentice, William Wilberforce, the grandfather to the abolitionist, married Thornton’s daughter, and the house passed onto the Wilberforce family in 1732. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nMerchants of Hull tended to carry out their trade with the Baltic states and Europe, differing from Bristol and Liverpool who had a large stake in the slave trade.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>The abolitionist</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nWilberforce was educated at Cambridge, where he met the future Prime Minister William Pitt and entered political life.

Slavery itself was, however, still able to continue. Wilberforce continued campaigning for the abolition of slavery until he retired from politics in 1825.

Around 150 AD the wooden bridge was destroyed by flooding, thus the Roman army built a new, predominantly stone bridge further downstream, the remains of which are what can be seen today. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/piercebridge-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Piercebridge\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Bridge <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nLater, during the 3rd century AD, a large fort was built to the south of the bridge to house auxiliary cavalry.

Whilst no British forts can be attributed to any one surveyor or architect, unique evidence uncovered at Piercebridge has identified Attonius Quintianus as a military surveyor working in Britain’s northern territories at this time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nFollowing the withdrawal of Rome’s forces during the 5th century AD, the fort and bridge were initially used by the local populace. However, the bridge later became disused following the river’s change of course, whilst the fort’s use subsequently dwindled and in later years the current village of Piercebridge developed directly above what remained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/piercebridge-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Piercebridge\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Fort <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhilst much of the site is covered by the existing village, interesting remains are still visible, of note are the foundations of the vicus’ bathhouse and the fort’s drainage system.

The North-East was a coal-mining area and from the early 1600s wagonways, made from wood and powered by horse-power, were used to convey coal along the Tyne. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nIn the early 1820s steam power began to be utilised for transportation between inland collieries and the ports. The use of locomotives for the S&DR railway was first proposed in 1821 to connect the mines in Darlington and Stockton, but there were numerous objections due to concerns about noise and smoke. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nHowever, George Stephenson, known to history as the ‘Father of the Railways’, persuaded the shareholders to order a steam-powered locomotive, and the imaginatively named Locomotion No.1 became the first engine built for the line. On the railway’s opening day the engine was driven by Stephenson himself, carrying coal and 450 passengers from Darlington to Stockton, getting up to 15 miles per hour in front of great crowds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/darlington-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Darlington\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Crowds watching the train cross Skerne Bridge in Darlington at the opening of the S&DR, watercolour by John Dobbin (1880s). <i>Source: Tomlinson, The North Eastern Railway, p. 112. </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Expansion and success</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nPublic demand for the service ensured the viability of the railway; just under eighteen months after its opening there were seven coaches running between Stockton and Darlington.

The line soon expanded, reaching Middlesbrough and Redcar in 1846.

Situated on the banks of the River Ribble, the fort’s strategic importance is evident in its chosen location beside a crossing over the river at a point where the roads from Eboracum (York), Deva Victrix (Chester) and Luguvalio (Carlisle) converged. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhilst initially built by the XXth legion using timber, the fort underwent a period of development during the late 1st century AD which saw the timber structure replaced with stone, indicating the presence of a more permanent settlement by this time. The fort was home to roughly 500 cavalry troops who were tasked with keeping the local population, the Brigantes tribe, under control.\r\nThe Latin name for Ribchester has the suffix Veteranorum, which suggests Roman army veterans also settled here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/bremetennacum-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Bremetennacum\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Roman ruins in Ribchester <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen retired from service, the veterans of Ribchester appear to have been granted use of the nearby marshland, in which they cut a series of drainage channels to allow the land to be used to grow crops and to raise cattle and horses. The decision to retire at this location, along with the presence of the strategically important road network, allowed Ribchester’s vicus (civilian settlement) to prosper until its eventual abandonment in the 4th century. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs with many forts of the period, Ribchester was endowed with a large bath house which was utilised by both the fort and vicus’ inhabitants. Erected in the 2nd century, the bath house consisted of a furnace room, a caldarium (hot room), a tepidarium (warm room), sudatorium (sweating room), a frigidarium (cold room) and an apodyterium (changing room). \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe excavated foundations of the bath house can be found behind the White Bull Inn, which is also home to four Roman Doric or Tuscan columns, two of which are believed to have come from the remains of the bath house. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>Visitor\'s information</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nVisitors to Ribchester can visit the bath house and the remains of the fort’s granary, both of which are free to enter and open all year round.

Binchester’s location ensured the fort’s longevity, with a Roman presence there until as late as the early 5th Century AD. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nBinchester was a sizeable fort and excavations have indicated that whilst initially built using wood, it was later rebuilt in stone and brick once the Romans felt secure in their surroundings. Excavations have also uncovered the remains of defensive structures, such as earthwork banks and a ballista (heavy missile launcher) platform, which suggest that the Romans were conscious of potential threats from the local population and so sought to prepare themselves accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\nWhilst Binchester was primarily built to house cavalry regiments from across the Empire, a thriving vicus (civilian settlement) also grew outside of the fort’s gates. A once brightly-painted bathhouse with seven-foot walls, along with an inscribed alter to the goddess Fortuna, are some of the site’s most significant finds. Of particular interest are the well-persevered remains of the bathhouse’s hypocaust (underfloor heating) system, which provide an opportunity to view the most intact system of its kind in Britain. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/binchester-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Binchester\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 2 - Binchester Roman Fort <i>Source:durham.gov.uk/binchester </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nA second bathhouse, located outside of the fort, affords visitors the opportunity to see a Roman bathhouse in an even better state of preservation, with walls still standing to a height of six feet above Roman floor level. \r\nThe site is in the care of Durham County Council and is open every day between 1st April to 31st October.

It has played an important role as the focal point for national celebrations and commemorations. The Palace measures 108 metres long by 120 metres deep, and it’s 24 metres high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>The Palace’s Origins</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe Palace originated as a townhouse known as Buckingham House, built in 1703 for the Duke of Buckingham. Sixty years later it was purchased by George III as a private residence for his wife, Queen Charlotte, and it became known as the Queen’s House. Following the death of George III, the Palace was enlarged and remodelled by the architects John Nash and Edward Blore. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/buckingham-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Buckingham\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 1 - Buckingham House, early 18th Century. <i>Source: Adriaen van Diest.

Victoria used it as a family home and a place of entertainment, but after Prince Albert’s death in 1861 the Palace became somewhat neglected. On the accession of her son, Edward VII, to the throne in 1901, Buckingham Palace was revived as a place of royal entertaining and played a central role in ceremonial events throughout the twentieth century.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBuckingham Palace was a symbol of resilience during World War Two; George VI and Queen Mary remained in residence for the duration of the War and were home when a bomb hit a part of the east side in September 1940. On the day victory was announced, five years later, the Royal Family and the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, walked out onto the balcony to a jubilant crowd.

(109, 'Kensington Palace', 'Kensington Palace is a royal residence, separated into numerous apartments. The palace has its origins as a two-storey mansion built in 1605. In 1689 William and Mary ascended the throne and began searching for a residence away from the river Thames. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThey bought the mansion, known as Nottingham House, from the Earl of Nottingham. The architect, Christopher Wren, was called upon to enlarge the building, creating impressive hallways and ornate decor. As a favourite residence of the King and Queen, Kensington Palace was used to host parties and receive foreign ambassadors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBoth William and Mary died at the Palace; Mary from smallpox in 1694 and William from pneumonia in 1702. \r\nThe palace continued to be developed by subsequent monarchs. One of the palace’s most famous features, the Orangery, designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor, was constructed in Queen Anne’s reign. During George I’s reign new royal apartments and a grand staircase were added, decorated by William Kent. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe gardens were redesigned to include features we still see today – such as the Serpentine and the Round Pond. Under George II the palace was managed by Queen Caroline, who hosted lavish receptions and intellectual meetings, but after her death in 1737 it became neglected. George II died in the Palace in 1760, becoming the last reigning monarch to inhabit it. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/kensington-palace-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Kensington\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 1 - Bronze statue of William III in front of the South Front of the Palace <i>Source: Tony Hisgett, Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>The ‘Kensington System</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nQueen Victoria, the daughter of George III’s fourth son, was born in the palace in 1819 and spent her protective childhood there.

At the time of its construction Whitehall Palace, in nearby Westminster, was the official residence of the monarchy and St James’s was used as a more informal residence away from the bustle of the main court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe red-bricked palace is organised around courtyards (Ambassador’s Court, Engine Court, Friary Court and Colour Court) and is home to an impressive four-storey gatehouse, which was decorated with the initials “H” and “A” to symbolise the love of Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn.  Henry’s cipher “H.R.” can also be seen at the Tudor gatehouse on St. James’s Street.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe subsequent Tudor monarchs made use of the palace - most notably by Elizabeth I, who stayed on the eve of her speech to the troops awaiting the Spanish Armada.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/james-palace-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"James Palace\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 1 – The North Gatehouse on Pall Mall, St James\'s Palace <i>Source:Tony Hisgett, Wikicommons</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>St James’s Palace during the Stuarts and Hanoverians</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe seventeenth century was quite a dramatic period for St James’s Palace.

The palace also saw the birth of numerous monarchs - Charles II, James II, Mary II and Anne.\r\n \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century it made its transition to the official palace of the monarchy after a fire in 1691 burned down most of Whitehall Palace.

She stated that,\r\n<mark>It has been with a struggle that I have nerved myself to a compliance with the wish that I should take part in this day’s ceremony; but I have been sustained by the thought that I should assist by my presence in promoting the accomplishment of his great designs to whose memory the gratitude and affection of the country are now rearing a noble monument, which I trust may yet look down on such a centre of institutions for the promotion of art and science as it was fond his hope to establish here. \r\n<br>\r\nIt is my wish that this hall should bear his name to whom it will have owed its existence, and be called ‘The Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences.’ </mark>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/royal-albert-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Royal Albert\" align=\"middle\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 2 - Trowel Used by the Queen in Laying the First Stone of the Royal Albert Hall.  <i>Credit: Illustrated London News.  </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/royal-albert-image3-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Royal Albert\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 3 - The Royal Albert Hall\'s opening ceremony, 1871.  <i>Credit: The Graphic </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Royal Albert Hall was officially opened on 29th March 1871 and has since hosted an array of events, from live orchestras, award ceremonies, charity events, banquets, ballet, opera, film screenings, sporting events, and music events: notably the BBC Proms concert series, which has been running since 1941. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s the acoustics of the Hall were improved by the installation of aluminium panels, colloquially known as the ‘mushrooms’.

The collections included some of the exciting new machines that had been on display at the Great Exhibition of 1851, but they also included some significant historical items.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThrough the efforts of the Bennet Woodcroft, the first superintendent, the collection grew to include the world’s earliest engines and locomotives, with the likes of Boulton and Watt beam engines (1780s), Puffing Billy (1814), and Stephenson’s ‘Rocket’ (1829). The collections continued to grow to include scientific instruments, and many were eventually moved into buildings across the road. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/science-museum-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Science Museum\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 1 - Entrance to the Patent Museum, 1863 <i> Credit: Science Museum.

It was not until 1909 that the science collections were officially separated as a new institution under the name the ‘Science Museum’. This separation had come after years of lobbying from the likes of Norman Lockyer, the founder of the science journal Nature, and Robert Morant, a civil servant. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThey had strongly advocated for a museum that was dedicated to science and industry. A year after its opening Hugh Bell was appointed as Chairman and he oversaw the first extensions to the site, which were hindered for a time by the First World War; the East Block was thus not opened until 1928. A children’s gallery was opened in 1931 complete with working models – an example of some of the earliest museum interactives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDuring the Second World War the museum was closed, and many of the collections were stored elsewhere. After the War many of the old buildings were demolished and new extensions were built. The 1970s saw the expansion of the institution to sites outside of London. The sites include The National Railway Museum in York, the National Museum of Photography (now the National Media Museum) in Bradford, and a storage facility at Wroughton, near Swindon. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>Opening times/access:</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nEntry to the Museum is free.

Ever since this time it has seen the coronation of every monarch of England, except Edward V and Edward VIII, who were never crowned. The Coronation Chair, also known as St. Edward’s Chair, is housed in the abbey and has been used at every coronation since 1308. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nNarrative and footage of the Coronation Chair at Westminster Abbey: \r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vawWBui4_kM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1245, under King Henry III, the building of the present church began, built in the new Anglo- French Gothic style.

In 1560 the building relinquished its status as an abbey or cathedral and became a “Royal Peculiar”, meaning that the church was not under the jurisdiction of bishops and answered only to the sovereign. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nUnder Mary I (1556-1559), a Catholic Queen, the monastery was restored. This was short-lived, as on the succession of her Protestant sister, Elizabeth I, the Abbot and the monks were once again removed. The abbey was made a Collegiate Church, presided over by a dean and a chapter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>Memorial and burials</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe abbey is also the burial place of aristocrats, and persons associated with the church. Geoffrey Chaucer was buried in the cloisters, having been employed as master of the King’s Works. Since then an area known as Poets’ Corner has been the burial place of other literary and musical figures associated with the abbey. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Westminster-image3-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Westminster\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 3 - View of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the nave <i>Source: theartssociety.org</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practice of burying significant persons in the abbey later widened to include prominent national, political, literary and scientific figures; with the likes of Isaac Newton (1727), George Frederick Handel (1759), William Wilberforce (1833), Charles Dickens (1870), Charles Darwin (1882), and Stephen Hawking (2018).

Under pressure from influential members of the Medical faculty the University was persuaded to refuse graduation to the women and referred the matter to the courts.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe courts declared that the women should never have been granted entry initially so their degrees were withdrawn.

(126, 'Victorian London', 'Queen Victoria reigned from 20th June 1837 to 22nd January 1901. Her long reign, of 63 years and 2 months, oversaw unprecedented change in Britain; the growth of the British Empire and trade, developments in technology, science, medicine and public health, architectural and art movements, as well as political change and great societal shifts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDuring the Victorian period towns and cities grew at an unparalleled rate across Britain. At the start of Victoria’s reign London, the capital of the British Empire, was already the largest city in the world with a population of around 2 million, but by the end of her reign the population in the capital would rise to over 6.5 million. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>London’s Infrastructure in the 19th century</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\nThe streets were bustling with people - and horses; it’s estimated that 500,000 of them were required to transport London’s citizens via carriages, carts, omnibuses, and trams. Earlier periods had seen public transport as a luxury only the wealthy could afford but the increasing number of operators and forms of transport drove down costs so that people were being carted around the city in numbers never seen before. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe London and Greenwich Railway, the first passenger steam railway, was opened in 1838. The Victorian era also saw the building of Euston (1837), Paddington (1838), Waterloo (1848), King’s Cross (1850), and Victoria (1860) railway stations – they became gateways to the rest of the Kingdom, facilitating trade and the movement of people. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1855 the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW) was created to administer the new infrastructure needed to accommodate the growing city, by clearing slums, creating new streets, and providing parks. London increasing growth of population led to severe overcrowding in the inner-city and it began to expand into surrounding towns and villages, which today make up Greater London. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1863 London became home to the world’s first underground railway, providing residents with the opportunity to leave the busy inner-city and live in the suburbs; giving London a glimpse into the commuter lifestyle that characterises it today. The suburban dream was helped along in the latter end of the century by the Cheap Trains Act (1883), which made train travel cheaper. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the very poor were still confined to inner city slums, whilst the rising middle-class aspired to own their own homes in the suburbs. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\"> <br><sub><q>Figure 1 - Construction of the Metropolitan Railway, the world\'s first underground railway near King\'s Cross <i>Source: The Illustrated London News, Wikimedia. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>“London is a Modern Babylon”: Immigration to the capital</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nIn 1851, over a third of all Londoners were born somewhere else. Many came from the British countryside but there were also large communities of refugees from Europe. Europe at the time was bursting with revolutions and political debate, bringing to England political refugees, including the likes of political heavy-weights like Karl Marx.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Irish were the largest immigrant group as a result of the Irish Famine (1846-1849), and the London Jewish community expanded during the second half of the nineteenth century, fleeing wars, persecution and famine. Chinese, Indian, African, and Caribbean communities were also established by the London docks. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli referred to London as “a modern Babylon” due to the myriad of cultures and languages forming in the capital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 2 - The market at Petticoat Lane where Jewish cloth-makers sold their wares (1887) <i>Source: W. Thornbury, Old and New London, Vol.2 (London, 1887), p. 139. Credit: Archive.org. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>London at Work</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe Industrial Revolution (c.1760-c.1840) and the advent of steam ushered in the age of mass production, changing the market dramatically and aiding the expansion of a middling class of merchants, tradesmen and craftsmen. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nLondon was home to an abundance of trades, from cloth merchants to brewers. Among the important industries in London was furniture making, the chemical industry, the leather industry, and the clothing trade. Goods from all over the Empire were also bought to London via the docks, making it the centre of global trade. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt has been established by historians that the alteration of demographic structures had a profound effect on consumption patterns, especially with a national and international market developing alongside transport improvements. London wholesalers and manufacturers could now transport their goods across the country a lot cheaper and quicker than previous eras.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nLife for the working class during the great manufacturing boom, however, was poor. Many of the factories were unventilated centres of disease, and the working day was long and strenuous. People tended to work on a casual basis, thus workers’ rights were meagre. Social reformers sought to improve working conditions. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1847 The Factory Act was passed, also known as the Ten Hours Act, restricting the working hours of women and children in textile mills to 10 hours per day.  A significant break-through for workers’ rights was the legalisation of trade unions in 1871. The last decades of the century saw the rise of organised labour movements and strikes. \r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>London at Play</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nLeisure time became increasingly considered. The introduction of the railways opened up opportunities for travel across the country, giving rise to popular seaside resorts, race meetings and football matches. London itself became a destination for visitors with an expanding infrastructure of shops, theatres and music halls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nNotably, over 6 million people visited the Great Exhibition at Hyde Park in 1851. It was the first exhibition of technology and culture in the world. In the aftermath of the Exhibition, public money helped to establish a hub of national museums in South Kensington, giving home to many of the objects that had been on display, and places for citizens to visit in their leisure time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Great Exhibition has notoriously been defined as a turning point for Victorian Society. It certainly gave the average citizen a glimpse into a future filled with exciting commodities, and with an increase of 70 percent in real wages over the course of the century, broader members of society were able to afford the proliferation of goods on offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image3-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 3 - An interior view of the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, 1851 <i>Source: Joseph Nash (1851). Credit: The Royal Collection Trust. </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nShopping became a significant activity. Innovative retail practices arose in the period with the likes of elaborate window displays, sales pushes, fixed prices, and differing forms of advertising; as well as new forms of retail with the multi-national and department store. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWindow-shopping was a desirable pastime, with the likes of the Burlington and Piccadilly Arcades showing off luxury goods for the gentility. Merchants also began targeting middle-class women, who were now valuable consumers with buying power. Large department stores also kept on top of the latest technological innovations to promote their wares; In 1898 Harrods became home to England’s first escalator. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>A New Visual Age</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe advertising industry boomed in the Victorian period. Technological advances in printing meant that it was cheaper to produce publications on a larger scale than ever before, particularly with developments like the introduction of the steam-roller press. Communication advances, with the railway and the electric telegraph, alongside the growth of national literacy opened up the world of print to a mass readership. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the Victorian era new Copyright Laws were passed, giving authors’ royalties for their penmanship. The novel became a popular art form with the genres of romanticism and science fiction gaining ascendency, in part influenced by idealised notions of the rural past and fears for the urban future respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image4-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 4 - The famous Victorian actress Lillie Langtry on a Carte-de-Viste <i>Source: The London Stereoscopic & Photographic Company, 1880-1890. Credit: The National Portrait Gallery.</i></q></sub>\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn this environment, celebrity culture flourished. In 1856 the National Portrait Gallery opened its doors providing visitors with a glimpse of the powerful and fashionable.  A new form of visual media arose in the 1860s with the introduction of mass-produced portraits called carte-de-viste. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor the first time the public could own images of famous actors, actresses, literary figures, sportsmen, and the Royal Family at an affordable price. They were extremely popular collectors’ items, for example, an album of portraits of Victoria and Albert commissioned by the Queen in 1860 sold 60,000 copies in its first week on the market.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>Public Health</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nWhilst the Victorian era was a time of great economic boom and cultural progress it was also a time of great poverty. Social commentators like Charles Dickens and Edwin Chadwick bought to light the major downfalls of Victorian Society. For a time, Dickens lived a few doors away from the Cleveland Street Workhouse, which no doubt influenced his writings.  Living conditions were poor and many lacked basic facilities, like clean water. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSewage was dumped into the Thames River causing a great deal of pollution. This led to the ‘Great Stink’ of the 1858 and three outbreaks of cholera. In the second half of the nineteenth century the civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette designed a new sewage system for London to aid drainage, helping to save thousands of lives. His sewer system still operates today. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image5-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 5 - \'Father Thames Introducing his Offspring to the Fair City of London\' <i>Source: Punch, 3rd July 1858. Credit: The British Library. </i></q></sub>\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe likes of cholera, typhoid, typhus, influenza, scarlet fever, and smallpox were the most common diseases, with epidemics wiping out significant numbers of the population. Some epidemics were so serious that they led to legislation being passed, for example, the Nuisances Removal Act (1855) was implemented in reaction to the cholera epidemic of 1853-1854. The State began to seek new ways to manage poverty and disease and put into action an array of public health measures, including the Compulsory Vaccination Act (1853), which made it compulsory for all children to be vaccinated against smallpox during the first three months of their life. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nNot everyone looked kindly upon the efforts of an increasingly interventionist state, and there was organised anti-vaccination movements throughout the country. The death rate from smallpox, however, fell rapidly as a result of the legislation. In 1848 the first Medical Officer for London was appointed, producing annual reports and statistics on the state of public health in London.  For the first time the health of the population of London was systematically recorded. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Officer also had the authority to inspect factories, housing, foodstuffs. In 1889 the Notification of Diseases Act was passed, requiring that Medical Officers’ notify the centre of the outbreak of certain diseases. When a disease alert was in place the given locality would receive official advice, which was then disseminated out to the locals. By the end of the period better sanitation led to a steady decline in the mortality rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image6-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 6 - Cholera Notice for the Limehouse District <i>Source:  Printed Cholera Notice, 1866. London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Library & Archives.

Notably, in the 1890s Robert Koch identified the micro-organisms that caused tuberculosis, which was widely lauded in the scientific and lay press. Many of these breakthroughs, however, took time to impact the day-to-day lives of the poor.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>Civic Pride and Welfare</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nA number of moneyed entrepreneurs used their wealth for the public good, seeking to address the discord between rising living standards and poverty. An example of this civic engagement can be seen from Thomas Barnado, an Irishman, who came to London during an outbreak of cholera in the 1866, which swept through the East End. As a result of the cholera outbreak many families were left destitute and children were orphaned. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBarnardo set up the ‘Ragged School’, to provide poor children with an education, and in 1870 he opened his first home for boys in Stepney Causeway. The Peabody Trust was also formed in the 1860’s, by the American banker George Peabody. The trust provided purpose-built housing for the poor, with the first block opened in 1864 in Spitalfields, containing 57 dwellings. Numerous other charities were formed in the period, such as the Charity Organisation Society and the Salvation Army. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWelfare was provided through voluntary and charitable organisations, whilst the State offered the destitute the Workhouse. The Poor Law Amendment Act (1834) tried to reconcile economic astuteness with humanitarian aid, seeking to define the ‘deserving poor’ by creating a system that dissuaded people from seeking relief. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere were a high number of workhouses in the capital, one of the largest was at St. Martin in the Fields in Westminster; In 1865 The Lancet, a medical journal, reported on the overcrowding and the neglect of paupers in their sick wards. The reports prompted discussion about failures of the workhouse system and helped lead to the passing of the Metropolitan Poor Act in 1867, which created the Metropolitan Asylum Board and provided a new system of care for the sick poor in the capital.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>Political and social ideologies</h3>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe extensive demographic, social, and economic changes since the beginning of the nineteenth century gave rise to new social theories and political movements. In 1859 Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species was published. Victorian thinkers used the theory of evolution for their own ends, applying it to ideas of race, class and British Imperialistic ‘progression’. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs the urban environment had led to such an array of health problems concerns over ‘de-evolution’ or physical degeneration abounded. There was anxiety that civilisation had reached its peak and would revert to a more primitive state. These fears were relayed in popular literature of the period, with the likes of R. L. Stevenson’s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886) and H. G. Wells’s The Time Machine (1895). \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n \r\nPolitical movements like socialism and liberalism were prominent in the period. Chartism was a working-class movement in Victoria’s early reign that sought to give more men representation in the House of Commons through the vote. The 1832, 1867, and 1884–85 Reform Acts extended voting rights to broader members of the population, not just those in the upper-classes of society. The Labour movement also began in the nineteenth century, with reformers aiming to improve the socio-economic realities of the lower-classes. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image7-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 7 - Daguerreotype of a large crowd of supporters of the Chartist movement gathered together on Kennington Common, 1848. <i>Source: Prince Albert purchased two daguerreotypes of the meeting in 1848.

In 1820, whilst she was still a baby, both her father and George III died. After the death of two of her uncles she became the sole heir to her Uncle, William IV, who had no children. Victoria was raised in Kensington Palace by her mother and had a controlled upbringing. At the age of 18 her Uncle, William IV passed away and Victoria succeeded the throne. Her official residence became Buckingham Palace.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image8-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 8 - Queen Victoria as a young woman, by F.W.

She immediately turned away from her controlling mother and looked for other figures to provide support. Her first Prime Minister Lord Melbourne became a friend and confidant. Victoria first met her future husband Albert in 1839 and they were married a year later. Over the course of the next sixteen years they would have nine children. Notably, Victoria was administered chloroform, an anaesthetic, for the birth of her eighth child, Prince Leopold. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h4>Civic Duty:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nVictoria and Albert undertook a significant number of civic duties, visiting hospitals, towns and supporting charities. Prince Albert developed a reputation for helping public causes, and in 1851 he was prominent in the organisation of the Great Exhibition. The Queen introduced the ‘Victoria Cross’ to honour soldiers’ bravery in the Crimean War, basing it on merit rather than rank. 62 men were presented with the medal in the 1857. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h4>Albert’s Death:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nIn the Winter of 1861 Albert died from Typhoid. The Queen was devastated and wore mourning clothes for the rest of her life. It would be almost a decade before the Queen partook in public engagements. Victoria commissioned a large number of memorials for Prince Albert, including the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image9-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 9 - Queen Victoria and Princess Alice in mourning. <i>Source: See,H.

In 1876 Victoria gained the title Empress of India, which bolstered her popularity and feelings of patriotism. The image of Britannia became a potent image in popular culture and advertising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image10-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 10 - Queen Victoria as Empress of India, 1876. <i>Source: W & D Downey Photographers.

The historian David Cannadine commented on the use of spectacle to legitimise the existence of the monarchy and the increased frequency of royal ceremonies in the Victorian era.\r\n<br><br>\r\nVictoria’s long reign also helped to garner popularity. On 20th July 1887 Victoria’s Golden Jubilee was marked with celebrations across the Empire. Soldiers from these disparate nations marched through London and a feast was held for foreign envoys and representatives. Victoria’s image was disseminated on mass-produced commemorative items, from mugs to postcards.  The commercial sector capitalised on the image of Victoria, appealing to patriotism to sell commodities. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/victorian-london-image11-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian London\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Figure 11 - Victoria\'s image used to sell Golfer Oats. <i>Source: John Johnson Collection.

When the Queen died she ruled over 400 million subjects, a quarter of the world’s population. She became the image of British Imperial power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nVictoria passed away in January 1901, aged 81. The Queen’s funeral was an elaborate affair, attended by European Royalty and marked with pageantry. Victoria’s reign had coincided with the advent of photography, and had seen unparalleled transformations in the social, economic, political and technological make-up of society.

(127, 'Edinburgh', 'Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland and a city that nearly half a million people call home.  In fact, people have been calling this fantastic location ‘home’ according to archaeological finds, as far back as 8500 BCE (the Mesolithic Period). \r\n\r\n<br><br><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\nTraces of later Bronze and Iron Age settlements have been found in the area, most notably on Castle Hill (the hill that leads up to Edinburgh Castle) and Arthurs Seat, the extinct volcano that sits within the boundaries of Holyrood Park.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see what attracted people to these sites as they are both commanding locations in relation to the surrounding countryside and they are within a short distance of the sea. And so, it became that this valuable real estate was fought over frequently throughout history, initially between local Celtic tribes, then towards the end of the first century by the Romans who marched in and claimed it as their own, displacing the Celtic tribe known as the Votadini.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/edinburg-main-image4-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Edinburgh\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Edinburgh <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nBy 211CE the Romans had retreated south behind Hadrians Wall and eventually left Britain for good in 411CE.  \r\nThe next 700 years was a tumultuous time for the country as a whole.  Various Kingdoms fought over its ownership and there was no stability until King David I of Scotland (Alba) defeated his nephew to claim the Kingdom of Scotland as his own and introduced feudalism into the Scottish psyche.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis period is referred to as the Davidian Revolution by scholars to summarise the changes that took place.  Part of this revolution was the foundation of ‘royal burghs’ of which Edinburgh was the most prominent.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDuring David I’s reign a royal castle was built at the top of Castle Hill replacing the old fort that had dominated its heights previously. He also founded Holyrood Abbey a mile away from the castle. A road sprung up between the two sites known as the Royal Mile and it is from this road that the modern shape of Edinburgh started to grow from. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/edinburg-main-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"EdinBurgh\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Edinburgh <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city’s oldest surviving building is St Margaret’s Chapel that is within the walls of Edinburgh Castle at its highest summit and was believed to have been built in the 12th Century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDuring the Wars of Independence, a series of military campaigns fought between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries the city changed hands numerous times and suffered a lot of damage.  The castle itself was captured by the English between 1296 and 1322 and in 1385 the Cathedral and Town Hall were burnt down.  Despite this the city still thrived and became famous for its main exports of wool and leather which were shipped out from the Port of Leith.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter defeat at the Battle of Flodden against the English in 1513, the inhabitants of the city built the Flodden Wall to protect themselves. However, the wall was not very effective and the English would breach it to attack the city on several more occasions. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt this time approximately 12000 people lived within the boundaries of Edinburgh but the population was expanding rapidly and it wasn’t long before the Royal Mile started to get built up as expansion was impossible due to the city walls hemming them in and soon multi-story houses, some up to 12 stories high began to line the roads.  A feature of the Royal Mile is these high-rise dwellings that soar above you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/edinburg-main-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Edinburgh\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Edinburgh <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1707 the Act of Union was signed and united the Kingdoms of England and Scotland which became the United Kingdom.\r\nEdinburgh continued to thrive and its population grew rapidly to such an extent that Daniel Defoe the English author of Robinson Crusoe commented on his visit that ‘in no city in the world [do] so many people live in so little room as in Edinburgh’.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis high population in cramped conditions made the whole place extremely unhealthy with bubonic plague, typhus and cholera problems that were faced on a daily basis by many people. Where Princes Street Gardens are now used to be known as the Nor Loch and was where the effluent and waste water were thrown by the residents of the Old Town. Edinburgh was one of the most unsanitary towns in Europe. But this was soon to change as the Nor Loch was drained and a massive development project began.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the 18th Century the city was at the centre of the Scottish Enlightenment and became known as the Athens of the North due to its neo-classical buildings and reputation for education. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBuilt in several stages from the 1760s to the 1830s, the New Town of Edinburgh was the largest planned city development in the world at that time, and it proved an outstanding success in bringing commercial and cultural dynamism to the city. It attracted the rich and powerful businessmen who had forsaken the Old Town for London to return to the new Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/edinburg-main-image3-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Edinburgh\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Edinburgh <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA new vibrant Edinburgh coupled with the Scottish Enlightenment that was sweeping Scotland between the late 18th and early 19th Century created huge advances in philosophy, political economy, engineering, architecture, medicine, geology, archaeology, law, agriculture, chemistry and sociology put Edinburgh and her universities firmly on the map. It was the place to be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDue to the Act of Union in 1707 the city was no longer restricted by its surrounding defensive walls and it quickly began to see growth in all directions.  By the end of the 19th Century nearly a quarter of a million people lived in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt became a centre of finance and trade.  The New Town had been built, the Old Town was getting upgraded to improve living conditions, Princes Street and surrounding areas were awash with new businesses and commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis expansion and improvement has continued to the present day, a new financial district has sprung up and Edinburgh is now recognised as the second largest financial and administrative centre after London.  The city also houses the Scottish Government who are responsible for governing Scotland and has done so since the Scotland Act of 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a fleeting introduction to Edinburgh throughout its history and with the help of the Hidden History App you really can turn the streets you walk on into the museum you never knew existed.

(128, 'Parliament Hill', 'In an area of open parkland in the south-east corner of Hampstead Heath in north-west London there is still a strong feeling of being very much a part of countryside. And yet, when standing at the viewpoint of Parliament Hill there is this sudden shift of being miles away from the big city. Approximately 6 miles out of the city of London the 791-acre heath, which is an amalgam of the grounds of several large houses that were once in the area, is the summit of Parliament Hill which provides a fantastic view towards London and is a focal point for locals and visitors alike.\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Parliament-Hill-hiddenhistory-london.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament Hill\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Land</h2>\r\n\r\nIt has been long suspected that the mound on top of the hill was a Bronze Age (2500 until c. 800 BC) burial barrow. The hill itself was part of a manor in 1133 during Henry I reign. He decided to give the land to Baron Richard de Balta. A grant was confirmed by Westminster to Richard de Balta of ‘land of the fee of Westminster of Hampstead’ for rent of two pounds a year. \r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nThis also included Abbot William de Humez (1214-22) being assigned the two-pound rent ‘from the manor of Hampstead’ to the abbey’s kitchen. It’s not clear if the grant was of the whole manor or of the estate within it. During Henry II reign the manor appears to have been passed onto Alexander de Barentyn who was the King’s butler. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nAs time went on the plots of land in the manor were sold off. Especially in the early 19th century. Although the hill remained mainly common land, The Metropolitan Board of Works (which was created to help provide infrastructure to cope with London’s rapid growth) acquired Hampstead Heath for the people in 1875, which didn’t include Parliament Hill. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Parliament_Hill_during_sunset.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament Hill\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The area that was known as Traitors\' Hill, may have acquired its current name during the English Civil Warin the 17th century. When it was occupied by troops loyal to the English Parliament. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nThirteen years later Parliament Hill was added to Hampstead heath for £300,000. The Manorial rights of the land remained in private hands until the mid-20th century. The manorial rights lapsed under Sir Spencer Pocklington Maryon Wilson. Though the estate itself was purely a formal position without any real power. It was then passed on to Shane Gough, 5th Viscount Gough. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nHampstead Heath including Parliament Hill was host to livestock. The cattle were reared to be sold through Smithfields the London meat market up until the 1940’s. The grass there today is bred farm grasses, which just shows a legacy from a time when the heath was an agricultural resource. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nGreater London Council managed Parliament Hill, which, was then taken over by Camden Council until 1989 when the City of London Corporation took ownership. \r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Parliament_Hill_romantic_scene.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament Hill\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>A legend states that this was the site from where Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby, of the Gunpowder Plot on November the 5th 1605, planned to watch the destruction of Parliament. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s in the Name?</h2>\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, long before Parliament Hill got its name it was referred to as Traitors Hill, possibly due to it being an execution site. A legend states that the hill is connected with the Gunpowder plot to blow up Parliament. It’s believed that Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby planned to watch Parliament being destroyed from the top of the hill on the 5th of November 1605. As intriguing as this is, especially in relation to the name Traitors Hill, the theory is unsubstantiated.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nIt was also suggested that the name Traitors Hill came about in the mid-17th century during the English Civil War. Troops loyal to Parliament would occupy the hill. With the modern houses of Parliament seen from the viewpoint, those who were against King Charles I and his views on the Irish insurrection would use the hill as a point of defence. It isn’t clear, if the name changed during the civil war or after but the name ‘Parliament Hill’ did come into existence. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Gunpowder_Plot_conspirators_hidden_history.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament Hill\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>A contemporary engraving of eight of the thirteen conspirators, by Crispijn van de Passe; Catesby is second from the right. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<h2>It’s not just about the View.</h2>\r\n\r\nParliament Hill is best known for its viewpoint at the top. Measuring 98.1 metres (322 ft) high, providing beautiful views across London. The view, which can be captured in one panorama, is one of three viewing locations on Hampstead heath that has been identified in Greater London Authority\'s London View Management Framework.This is in recognition of the significant views towards St Pauls Cathedral and Victoria Tower at the Palace of Westminster. The viewpoint is also at times referred to as “kite hill” due to the popularity of flying kites on a sunny day.However, there is more to the area then meets the eye. Parliament Hill not only has some key landmarks but also holds various sporting events. It is also home to a flock of Flamingos. \r\n \r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/kite_flying.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament Hill\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The viewpoint is also at times referred to as “kite hill” due to the popularity of flying kites on a sunny day.. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Parliament Hill Lido.</h2>\r\n\r\nThe Parliament Hill Lido can be found at the bottom of the hill next to Gospel Oak railway station. The pool turned 80 years old in 2018 and is popular with locals as a place to exercise or just cool off in an outdoor pool. On the 20th of August 1938 the now Grade II-listed Lido was opened. At the time it was the most expensive of the 13 outdoor pools in London County Council that was built between 1920 and the outbreak of the Second World War. When it originally opened diving-boards adorned its sides as well as a slide. However, today the offering is more simplistic.In 1990, Historic England listed the lido under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2005 the Lido underwent an extensive refurbishment. It now boasts a new stainless-steel liner (the only one of its kind in an outdoor pool in the UK) and reflective qualities that not only help retain heat, but also gives the water an extra shimmer. The pool isn’t just for families and wetsuit-clad fitness fiends, the lido will also be used for forthcoming triathlons. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Parliament_Hill_lido_hidden_history_london.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament Hill\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>Built in 1938 and Grade II-listed, this is the only stainless steel lined outdoor pool in the country.

The bandstand that stands today was actually built in the 1990’s as the original was rundown. The original however, was based on the other side of Kite Hill on the banks of Highgate Ponds in the early 1900’s. The Bandstand was the subject of many attractive posters and black and white snapshots, which proved that the spot was quite the tourist attraction and as a place to see and be seen.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nToday’s bandstand can be found next to the Farmers Markets and Cricket ground. The current design is based on the original. There is no particular record of when the original and sizeable circular seating area around disappeared from Parliament Hill Fields, however there was a post-war carbuncle that was certainly in operation in the current location from the 1950’s.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/bandstand_at_parliament_hill_hidden_history.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament Hill\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<sub><q>The bandstand that stands today was actually built in the 1990’s as the original was rundown. <i>Source: Julian Osley / Bandstand, Parliament Hill Fields</i></q></sub>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nIn the late 1960’s Camden Council organised a series of free concerts at the bandstand. Beginning in September 1968, on a rainy Wednesday the Jefferson Airplane and Fairport Convention played to only a few hundred tuned-in people. The following summer the council progressed their free Camden Festival concept further by putting on three weekly parties throughout May. The first band to perform at the festival was Pink Floyd. The band were squeezed into the corrugated iron shed while battling the feedback from their PA. <mark>The following week the crowd doubled in size.</mark>\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nThis was partly due to John Peel mentioning the events on his radio shows and by week three Fleetwood Mac played with 25,000 people turning up. Sadly, Fleetwood Mac only played a couple of songs before being forced off the stage due to a group of people causing trouble.\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nIn recent years more celebrities have brought attention to the bandstand. In 2006 Booker Prize-winning local author Alan Hollinghurst fought a long and ultimately fruitless battle to have a programme of Sunday afternoon brass, jazz and Japanese music performed at the bandstand blocked. The grounds of the “intolerable noise nuisance” ABBA’s Benny Anderson also brought international attention to the bandstand by performing some of the pop classics he penned in a ‘comeback gig’ as part of a Swedish cultural celebration. \r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Parliament_Hill_hiddenhistory_london_bandstand.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament Hill\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nTo hear more about the Pink Floyd gig ‘The Archive’ has documented stories of those who were present which, can be accessed <a href=\"http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/pinkfloyd5-9-69.html\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a>\r\nThe bandstand today is a focal point for a lot of the Heath events and like previous generations of school kids it is still a popular meeting spot during the week.

On the other side there is an adventure playground for the kids. \r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nParliament Hill is one of the focal points of Hampstead Heath overall and provides Londoners a small piece of the countryside while living in the capital city.

(134, 'The Watts Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice', 'Sitting against an adjoining wall in Postman’s Park – aptly named as it was once the site of the headquarters of the General Post Office where the postmen used to go during their breaks – this little-known monument remembers the lives of 62 people who died selflessly trying to save another. \r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThis memorial to everyday heroism and self-sacrifice was proposed by the painter and sculptor, George Frederic Watts, in a letter to the editor of The Times in 1887 as part of the celebrations of Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee. He, like many wealthy people in the late Victorian period, believed in the need for social reform for the poor in England, and in turn saw a need to actively remember the heroism of ‘ordinary’ people. In his letter he wrote:\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<mark> “The character of a nation as a people of great deeds is one, it appears to me, that should never be lost sight of. It must surely be a matter of regret when names worthy to be remembered and stories stimulating and instructive are allowed to be forgotten… It is not too much to say that the history of Her Majesty’s reign would gain a lustre were the nation to erect a monument, say, here in London, to record the names of these likely to be forgotten heroes”. <small> George Frederic Watts</small>\r\n</mark>\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/George_Frederic_Watts\'s_Memorial_to_Heroic_Self_Sacrifice.jpg\" alt=\"The Watts Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nDespite this initial suggestion for the memorial, it wasn’t officially opened until 30 July 1900. In 1898, Watts was invited by the vicar of St Botolph’s church – the space being their former churchyard – to create the monument in the now public park. So, in 1899 the construction began of the 50ft long 9ft high shelter by J. Simpson and Son for the tablets at the cost of £402. Benches were also installed to encourage the public to stay a little longer. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpace was made available for 120 tablets (in rows of 24), though only 54 tablets have been installed so far. Each tablet is made up of small tiles and records the name(s) of the deceased with the details and date of the events making them worthy of remembrance. Only 4 of these plaques were installed when the monument was opened. The remainder of the first row included 9 installed in 1902, and 11 more along with T. H. Wren’s memorial to Watts in 1905 following his death the year before. All 24 of these tablets were designed by the ceramicist William De Morgan. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/Postman\'s_Park_Wall_of_Heroes.jpg\" alt=\"The Watts Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nA further 29 tablets were designed by Royal Doulton, 24 of which were installed altogether in 1908 filling a second row. Another 5 Doulton-style tablets were added on the next row from 1919-1930, which included replacement of a De Morgan tablet with incorrect information. A further tablet in the original De Morgan style created by Fred Passenger was slotted into the old spot for the incorrect tablet in 1931. Finally, the 54th tablet was added much later in 2009, commemorating Leigh Pitt who died saving a boy from drowning in 2007.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nOne of the people featured in the memorial is Alice Ayres, who died in 1885 while trying to save three children under her care from an upper-story of a burning house. Two of the three children survived, and Alice died in the process of trying to save herself as she fell awkwardly after jumping out the window. She was one of the most famous additions to the memorial and had already been commemorated in other ways across the country around the time of her death – this included in memorials, artwork and a street was renamed after her near to where she died on Union Street in 1936.

(136, 'Sutton Hoo', 'The Anglo Saxon Royal Cemetery at Sutton Hoo is a unique 6th to 7th century burial ground of high status individuals. Around twenty earthen burial mounds make up the cemetery and, while they may seem unremarkable from the surface, archaeologists have discovered far more beneath the surface. These mounds were designed to be seen and to make a statement about the status of the individuals interred beneath them.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUnfortunately, many of the mounds were damaged as a result of being robbed during the Tudor period something which is woefully common for visible burial mounds as they would often be looted in pursuit of  \'treasure\'. Since then, however, numerous investigations have taken place surrounding the mounds. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe first proper excavation was conducted in 1939 by self-taught archaeologist Basil Brown, commissioned and organised by the landowner, Edith Pretty. It was this first dig that uncovered the great ship burial of Mound One and made Sutton Hoo a centre of archaeological exploration ever since. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Sutton Hoo\"><br>\r\n<sub><q>Helmet from the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, England. 7th century AD.<i>Source: British Museum // Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h2>Burial Mounds</h2><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe most famous of the mounds is Mound One, where an immense 90ft ship burial was first unearthed in 1939. There are actually two ship burials at Sutton Hoo - the lesser known being under Mound Two. Unfortunately, this burial was disturbed by looters, but iron ship rivets reveal the presence of a small boat under the mound. This style of burial reflected contemporary practices in 7th century Sweden, showing a connection between Anglo Saxons in (what is now known as) East Anglia and cultures elsewhere in northern Europe. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe funerals would have been performative with lavish grave goods, ceremony and the construction of the immense mounds would have been made by hand. Not only was the burial packed with an abundance of rich grave goods, but the committal of an entire ship to the ground would have been an amazing spectacle. It would have cemented in their memory the royal status and significance of the individual buried. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Slim Statue\"><br>\r\n<sub><q> Burial mound at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, UK. This mound has been reconstructed to its supposed original height. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhile we cannot be sure exactly who was buried, it is generally accepted that this is the likely resting place of Raedwald, ruler of the East Angles and the first king to rule as overlord over England as a whole. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAccording to Bede\'s Historia Ecclesiastica, Rædwald was amongst the earliest Anglo Saxon rulers in England to be baptised and he is credited with playing a significant role in the establishment of Christianity within the ruling classes. His new faith, however, earned the disapproval of his household and queen, who tried to coax him back to his pagan Gods (Plunkett 2005). \r\n<br><br>\r\nRædwald maintained elements of his pagan lifestyle and allowed the East Angles to worship both the Christian and the traditional Anglo-Saxon religions if they desired, something the devout Bede criticised him for. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAs a result of the immense wealth, status and religious associations of the individual under Mound One, it’s clear to see why Raedwald is such a strong candidate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h2>Artefacts in focus</h2><p class=\"text-justify\"> \r\nFortunately, not all the mounds were looted and this meant that, upon excavation, archaeologists uncovered a trove of rich grave goods in their original position. These grave goods (objects placed in a grave alongside a body) can be used to give us an insight into the wealth of the individual. \r\n<br><br>\r\nFor example, the grave is full of military equipment and valuable weapons, indicating their role as a warrior king within Anglo Saxon society. Similar equipment is found underneath Mound Seventeen, where a young warrior is poignantly buried alongside their horse and an abundance of weapons – their horse would have been sacrificed for the funeral which would have been a spectacular albeit grisly ritual display. \r\n<br><br>\r\nChristian faith is also demonstrated in several of the items that accompanied the individual to the grave. These objects are amongst the main reasons that the grave is thought to belong to Rædwald. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAs religious beliefs can play such a huge part in people’s understanding of death and the afterlife, objects with religious motifs and associations are common finds, especially at times of religious transition such as Anglo Saxon period. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image4-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Slim Statue\"><br>\r\n<sub><q> Burial chamber of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, England. Reconstruction shown in the Sutton Hoo Exhibition Hall.<i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor example, ten nested silver bowls from the Eastern Empire were found alongside two Byzantium silver spoons with the names of the Apostles ‘Paul’ and ‘Saul’ engraved on them, in Greek. These are suggested to be possible baptismal gifts, buried as a symbol of Raedwald’s conversion to Christianity. There are also symbols of crosses on brooches, and a secret chamber hidden in the back of the gold Great Buckle that may have housed a Christian relic. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Great Buckle is an incredible example of master goldsmithing, with interwoven ribbon animal decoration and fine detailing. Perhaps the most exquisite artefacts found in the grave are a pair of fine filigree worked shoulder clasps, inlayed with garnets, millefiori designs, interlacing ribbon animal decoration and filigree surrounds. The motifs on the buckle are packed full of Anglo Saxon symbolism, cementing Raedwald’s cultural identity.\r\n<br><br>\r\n \r\nThe Sutton Hoo helmet is perhaps the most recognisable artefact from the grave. As well as its striking appearance and precious materials, it is laden with symbolism. It has been argued that the helmet makes reference to one-eyed Odin from Norse Mythology (Price and Mortimer 2014), due to imagery represented across northern Europe. If you look closely, you will notice a deliberate absence of gold foils over the left eye of the helmet and over the left eye of an animal head near the crow. \r\n<br><br>\r\n \r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image5-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Slim Statue\" ><br>\r\n<sub><q>Sutton Hoo helmet reconstructed. <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons. </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the low light of a feasting hall, this would result in the illumination of the right eye, and the casting of a shadow over the left – a powerful allusion to Odin and possibly declaring the wearer to be of the same status as the pagan god.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe placement of drinking horns (a common Anglo Saxon grave good) in the grave may have also served to create an image of the “worthy dead” (Pollington 2011: 21) as the possession and use of feasting equipment marked an individual’s place within society. The feasting equipment and lyre paint an image of a mead hall, full of music and celebration, with Rædwald as the gracious host. The funeral itself may have included some mead-fuelled celebration of the life of the deceased. Evidence of funerary feasting at the grave-side is common at Anglo Saxon burial sites (Lee 2007), and it may have been part of a transitionary ritual to aid passing into the afterlife.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h2>Ghosts in the sand</h2><p class=\"text-justify\"> \r\n\'Taphonomy’ is the study of the preservation, decay or changes to archaeological material after it has been deposited in the ground. A detailed, forensic approach to excavation and study of excavated material allows archaeologists to reconstruct the story of what has happened to organic material before, during and after burial. <mark>Soil conditions, burrowing animals, climate and even gnawing dogs can have a huge impact on survival of organic material.</mark>\r\n<br><br>\r\nAt Sutton Hoo, the acidic soil conditions meant that the great oak ship did not survive its 1400 years in the soil and the bones of Raedwald had long-since decayed. How, then, did archaeologists claim to ‘find’ the great ship burial and burials? \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image6-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Slim Statue\"><br>\r\n<sub><q>Sand Bodies of Sutton Hoo.<i>Source: P.M.Sabin Moore Blog </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\nGhosts of the organic materials appeared as staining in the acidic yellow sand - archaeologists have to have a keen eye for changes in soil colour and texture, so they were able to spot these anomalies and excavate around them, creating ‘sand people’ (similar in appearance to some of the Pompeii casts) or identifying the structure of the ship. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThese were inhumation burials, but cremation burials were also uncovered at Sutton Hoo. Cremations are likely to have been the earliest at the site (Carver 1998) and are found under several mounds, as well as in the surrounding area. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAs well as visible staining, decaying organic material can leave invisible traces of phosphates in the soil. In 1967, soil analysis from Mound One revealed a significant spike in the phosphate levels, indicating that there had once been a body in the grave but it had dissolved in the acidic environment.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>Visiting Sutton Hoo</h3> \r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/sutton-hoo-image7-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Slim Statue\"><br>\r\n<sub><q>Sutton Hoo Exhibition Hall with Helmet sculpture.  <i>Source: Wikimedia Commons </i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\nMany of the artefacts from across the Sutton Hoo site can be seen in the British Museum, but replicas and original are also housed in the Sutton Hoo visitor centre. \r\n<br><br>\r\nDue to a development project currently being undertaken at the National Trust site, the visitor centre and cemetery reopen to the public from late spring to early summer of 2019.

The Soviet Blockade of Berlin in 1948 resulted in the division of the city into two separate units, and a the ‘Berlin wall’ was erected in 1961 to control the two territories causing mass devastation, death and political controversy. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Wall was breached on the evening of 9th November 1989 and was gradually dismantled in stages thereafter, freeing the two zones from opposing control. – don’t miss this incredible piece of European history on your visit to the museum. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.

Thousands of doodlebugs were launched against London, and they subsequently became notorious for their distinct sound and sudden silence before exploding and causing mass devastation on the city. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nThe V2 rocket was launched in September of the same year and was known for being much larger and more dangerous than the V1 due to its silent nature that continued until its landing.

The Catacombs:</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/kensal-green-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Kensal Green Cemetery\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>The Catacombs <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nFascinatingly, Kensal Green Cemetery is home to three separate Catacombs systems which makes it unique amongst the other cemeteries of its kind. The first, Catacomb A, is located beneath the North Terrance Colonnade which is unfortunately now sealed off. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe second, Catacomb Z is beneath the Dissenters’ Chapel and suffered significant bomb damage during the Second World War which means it too, is closed to further deposits.  Lastly, located in the centre of the cemetery beneath the Anglican Chapel is Catacomb B, although this catacomb is currently not maintained by the cemetery staff, it can be visited as a part of a guided tour of the cemetery. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Chapel also has a working coffin-lift (catafalque) which was restored by The Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery in 1997.\r\n\r\n \r\n<h3>2.

Blondin toured the United States of American in 1885 and owed his fame to crossing the 1,100ft Niagara Falls Gorge on a tightrope in 1859. Blondin repeated this challenge several times, often including theatrical variations into the routine, such as being blindfolded, on stilts and even carrying a man (his manager Harry Colcord) on his back!\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1861 he appeared at the Crystal Palace in London, with a routine of somersaults on stilts again, on a tightrope and continued his routine throughout the UK. In 1897, Blondin sadly died of diabetes at the age of 72 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery alongside his second wife, Charlotte Lawrence. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. West London Crematorium:</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/kensal-green-image4-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Kensal Green Cemetery\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>West London Crematorium <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nLike many other cemeteries, Kensal Green Cemetery is also home to the famous ‘West London Crematorium’ which was developed in the eastern part of the grounds in 1939. \r\n<br><br>\r\nSimilarly maintained by the General Cemetery company, the crematorium has played its part in a number of notable cremations which include Hollywood icon Ingrid Bergman (1915-1982), actor and director Alan Rickman (1946-2016) and lead singer of Queen Freddie Mercury (1946-1991) who is commemorated by a small plinth under his real name, Farrokh Bulsara. \r\n\r\n<h3>4. The Sarcophagus of Princess Sophia (1777-1848)</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/kensal-green-image5-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Kensal Green Cemetery\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>The Sarcophagus of Princess Sophia <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaughter of King George III (Mad King George) and Queen Charlotte, Princess Sophia was born in 1777 and led a relatively cloistered life due to her father’s possessiveness (as he preferred his daughters to his sons) and insanity and mother’s strictness. When her father died, Princess Sophia was allowed greater freedom under the Regency of her brother, the Prince of Wales, although she still could not escape the royal institution through marriage. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSophia fell deeply in love with Major-General Thomas Garth who was a British Army officer and chief equerry to her father King George III, and it was believed that during the winter of 1799 at Windsor Castle Sophia conceived his illegitimate son Thomas Garth junior (1800-1873). \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn her final years, Sophia resided in the household of Princess Victoria of Kent (the future Queen Victoria) where Victoria’s infamous comptroller, Sir John Convoy, who took advantage of her senility and blindness by bullying her into spying on both the Kensington household, as well her two brothers, all whilst he stole most of her inheritance.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSophia sadly died in 1848 at Kensington Palace and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery upon her wish to be near her brother, Prince Augustus Frederick who lies on the opposite side of the path.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>5. Dissenters’ Chapel and The Reformers Memorial</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/kensal-green-image6-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Kensal Green Cemetery\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Dissenters’ Chapel and The Reformers Memorial <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nLocated in the E corner of the cemetery is the Greek revival ‘Dissenter Chapel’, which was built for all non-Anglican denominations/ non-believers. Since the cemetery was a favoured spot for nonconformists, free-thinkers and atheists etc, this chapel became the ‘it’ place for a number of them to be buried in, which was unique for the period. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe chapel is currently being used as the office for the Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery, however it can also be used for secular and dissenting funeral services. Following on from the Dissenters’ Chapel is The Reformers’ Memorial which was erected in 1885 by Joseph Corfield, in memorial ‘to the memory of men and women who had generously given their time and means to improve the conditions and enlarge the happiness of all classes of society’. \r\n<br><br>\r\nComprised of 75 social reformers and activists, the memorial is a testimony to a plethora of incredible people who used their positions to try a shape Victorian society for the better.

The cemeteries unique blend of culture and architectural styles makes it a unique experience for visitors- lets get into some of these must-see sights that cannot be missed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nTop 5 must see sights of West Norwood Cemetery \r\n<h3>1. Henry Tate (1819-1899)</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/west-norwood-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"West Norwood Cemetary\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Henry Tate <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people reading this may recognise the surname of this famous resident, as he is in fact THE Henry Tate who established the Tate Britain Gallery, London in 1897. \r\n\r\n<br><br> \r\nBorn in 1819 in Lancashire, Henry Tate was an English sugar merchant and philanthropist who was the son of a unitarian Clergyman. Tate’s wealth grew from the success of his sugar and grocery business, and he soon became a member of the aristocracy who donated generously to charity. \r\n\r\n<br><br> \r\n\r\nIn 1889, Tate donated a collection of 65 contemporary paintings to the government on the condition that they be displayed in a gallery (towards which he donated £80,000 for them to build) The National Gallery of British Art (Now Tate Britain) was opened on 21st July 1897, and throughout his lifetime Tate continued to donate, often anonymously, to a plethora of causes he held passionate about.\r\n\r\n<br><br> \r\n\r\nA fun fact about the man behind the gallery is that he was made a Baronet in 1898, after continually refusing the title, because he was told the Royal Family would be offended if he refused it again! Sir Henry Tate is buried in a family mausoleum in the Cemetery, be sure not to miss this important figure of London’s history. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/west-norwood-image2b-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"West Norwood Cemetary\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Henry Tate <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>2.

The catacombs are laid out in six vault passages, which are comprised of 95 vaults with a capacity for 3500 coffins which are comprised of both private and shared loculi (which are coffin spaces). \r\n\r\n<br><br> \r\n\r\nIn the centre of the catacombs, there is a hydraulic catafalque which was a coffin lift designed by Bramah and Robinson in 1839 to transfer coffins from the chapel which was above them down into the catacombs for final burial. The Catacombs are not currently open to the public; however, tours are often available throughout the year- Be sure to check out the West Norwood Cemetery for more information about booking this tour.  \r\n\r\n<br><br> \r\n\r\n<h3>3. Henry Doulton (1820-1897)</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/west-norwood-image4-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"West Norwood Cemetary\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Henry Doulton <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother name readers may recognise is Henry Doulton, a Victorian inventor and manufacturer of pottery who was also an instrumental developer in the creation of Royal Doulton ceramics. Born in Vauxhall in 1820, Doulton was the second of eight children and the son of a potter manufacturer and business owner, to which Henry himself joined in 1835. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nDoulton experimented with a variety of methods and styles of potter making, and in 1846 he superintended the manufacture of drainage and sanitary appliances in Lambeth which helped to make the firm famous. In 1870 the manufacture of ‘art pottery’ began in Lambeth, which joined together the skills of the students from the Lambeth Art school (now the City and Guilds of London Art School) where a variety of porcelains and earthenware was produced. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Doulton business continued to expand and prosper across the years, as did Doulton himself who received a knighthood in 1887 and also the Albert Medal by the Royal Society of Arts in 1885. Sadly however, Doulton died at his residence in London in 1897 and he was placed in a mausoleum in West Norwood Cemetery which is constructed from red pottery tiles and brick from the Doulton Works, which subsequently made it a Grade II listed building. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>4.

However, interestingly her surname \"Palaeologue\" takes its descent from the Byzantine Greek family who rose to nobility and produce the last ruling dynasty of the Byzantine Empire in the Duchy of Montferrat (an area in Northern Italy). \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nUpon further research, the Times Newspaper also seems to explore the mystery of Princess Eugenie claiming that had ‘descent from Constantine the Great, and who at one time laid claim to the throne of Greece’. Although very few records of this kind exist, I was able to uncover that Eugenie was married to Colonel Edmund H. Wickham (Royal Artillery) with whom she had four sons with, who sadly all died before her in the First World War and another who tragically drowned at Teddington Weir. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter suffering from ill-health for several years before, Princess Eugenie died in 1934 at the age of 86. Her funeral service was held at a Greek Church in Bayswater, from where she was taken to West Norwood Cemetery to be buried along side her husband and two of her four sons.<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/west-norwood-image5b-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"West Norwood Cemetary\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Princess Eugenie Palaeologue <i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>5.

John Major’s government - under pressure from the Ulster Unionists - backtracked on this condition, instead demanding that the IRA must disarm completely. This enraged the IRA and was viewed as a direct call for them to surrender. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of February 1996, a modified Ford truck was transported all the way from Northern Ireland to Barking. On board the vehicle was the IRA’s response to the British government; a massive 3,000 pound fertiliser bomb which had been fitted with booster tubes containing an additional 10 lb of Semtex. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 5 am on the 9th of February, the IRA parked their truck in South Quay. Before leaving the scene, the driver primed the explosive which had been fitted with a two-hour timer. Half an hour later an IRA spokesperson issued a statement to the Irish broadcasting network RTÉ, the message clearly outlined that the group intended to end their ceasefire at 6 pm.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/ira1996bomb-image2-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"IRA 1996 Bomb\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>The devastation caused by the IRA’s 1996 Docklands bombing in London <i>Source:Belfast Telegraph. </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nRTÉ were sceptical about the message and decided not to cover the story in their 6 o’clock bulletin, however, this should not have hindered evacuation attempts, the IRA also sent detailed coded messages to other outlets such as the offices of The Irish News.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nDespite this, confusion reigned as authorities attempted to get to grips with the situation. Even though the evacuation attempt had started at 6 pm, plenty of people were still in the vicinity as the bomb exploded an hour later. The blast was devastating, a 32 foot wide and 10 foot deep crater was left in the place where the truck had been. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nTragically, two people lost their lives while an additional 100 were injured, many suffering life altering injuries as a result of the bomb. The attack was condemned by the British and Irish governments but played some role in getting the UK back around the negotiating table, as Major’s government quickly dropped any talk of disarmament and talks resumed in June. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nA small bronze coloured plaque dedicated to those caught up in the attack now sits between the entrances to the South Quay Station, a mere 80 yards away from the site that the IRA chose to detonate their bomb and send the city of London into chaos once more. \r\n', 'ira1996bomb-image1-mobile.jpg', 1, 0, 0, 0, '-0.016368', '51.500201', 1, 1, 1, 0, 'London, UK', ''),
(146, 'Piddington Roman Villa', 'Following the Roman occupation of Britain, an increasing number of rural homes were built across the province. Named ‘villas’ these complexes were in theory the Roman equivalent of farms, however a secondary, perhaps more accurate, definition would be that they were rural dwellings of some pretension, which sometimes had agricultural associations. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBuilt during the mid-1st century AD, Piddington Roman villa is an example of a ‘winged-corridor’ villa, a type of villa that became prolific during the period. ‘Winged-corridor’ villas were formed when nearby buildings were gradually linked to a main villa using a covered corridor to extend the dwelling. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs agricultural dwellings, villas were more than lavish homes, they were also businesses, often requiring the successful production and sale of goods to support those that lived in them – in one complex alone this could include the villa’s owner and his family, servants, overseers and labourers. Remains from Piddington’s final phase of occupation support this view, with evidence of industrial use represented in the finding of iron slag which suggests the presence of an iron working site with furnaces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/paddington-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Darlington\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>Piddington Roman Villa <i>Source: Wikimedia </i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nPiddington remained occupied throughout the Roman occupation, however quickly fell into disrepair as Rome’s forces were withdrawn in 5th century AD.

Whist this means the entirety of the villa is not available to view (new sections are excavated and can be viewed each year), artefacts from the site along with information about the villa can be found at the Piddington Roman Villa Museum. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>Visitor\'s information</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nThe site and museum are managed by the Upper Nene Archaeological Society and are open every Sunday afternoon (1st Oct to 31st Mar - 2pm to 4pm, 1st Apr to 30th Sep - 2pm to 5pm). <br><br>\r\nThere is an entrance fee, Adult £3.50, Child £2.00, however this gives visitors access to both the museum and the villa site.

It would be the first of five cliff railways for the popular resort. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDesigned by William Lucas and built by the Crossley Brothers of Manchester, the original system was powered by seawater pumped by two Crossley gas engines and operated by a brakeman in the top station; the system was later replaced by steam engines in 1879 and then electric in the 1940s. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hidden-history.com/public/assets/images/lift-image1-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Scarborough\">\r\n<br>\r\n<sub><q>View of the cliff lift from below.<i>Source: Wikicommons.</i></q></sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>The cultural origins of the cliff lift</h3><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\nSpa waters were discovered in the cliffs in the 1620s by Mrs Thomasin Farrer, a member of the gentry, who noticed the water stained the stones russet-brown. Scarborough soon became fashionable amongst the upper classes for the waters perceived curative effect. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy the end of the century Scarborough was a popular seaside resort: in 1700 a local businessman, Dicky Dickenson, opened the first ‘spaw’. Lodging houses and hotels were formed in Georgian times and a popular music hall and saloon were added in the Victorian period. There were, however, problems with accessibility for an increasing number of visitors due to the seafront being next to the cliffs. In the 1820s a bridge had been built to connect the resort to the town centre. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTowards the end of the century, technological improvements in railways meant that funiculars could be utilised to help visitors navigate the resort. 1400 passengers were carried on the first day of business on 6th July 1875, allowing them to avoid walking the steep 224 steps to the top, for just 1d. \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nA visitor to the resort commented on its effectiveness at the end of a day by the seafront, “The anthem played by the band was the signal to go, and moving southward, much as we felt inclined to linger, reached the Cliff tramway, and were in the space of minute placed safely and without fatigue on the top of the cliff” (The Dundee Evening Telegraph - 24 June 1881).

The V&A has its origins in the Great Exhibition of 1851, held in Hyde Park. \r\n\r\n<br><br><p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\nPrince Albert wanted to use the profit from the exhibition to fund permanent establishments dedicated to industrial education and the arts.

Henry Cole, the museum’s first director, used unique methods to encourage people to enjoy culture, he introduced three refreshment rooms to the museum, an unknown concept at the time, thus becoming the world’s first museum to have a restaurant. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe South Kensington Museum was also the first in the world to use gas lighting in the galleries, allowing for late night openings.
